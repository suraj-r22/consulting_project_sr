# consulting_project_sr
This code contains the cleaning and EDA I conducted for a consulting project I did at UCLA. Our aim was to see if we could find discernible differences between stem students and non-stem student experiences, based on class review data from Bruinwalk.com. 

Due to the data being webscraped, it was quite unstructured, so it involved a lot of cleaning, which is what I handled.
