Professor Russell is not the best at technology and since everything was online (and the transition to remote learning was really fast), the first few weeks of chem 20L was pretty rough and disorganized. In my opinion, this class had a little bit too much work for a lab class.Lectures: attendance is not mandatory I believe (I stopped showing up after week 8), and Professor Russell herself is not engaging and pretty dull. She records and posts her lecture presentations online. I think her lectures are alright; for me, I would read the supplemental readings on CCLE to get a full understanding of the material.Labs: Pre and Postlabs are due before your lab section, but since this was all online, we were allowed to turn in our labs on Friday with no penalty. You basically had two different kinds of labs to turn in most weeks so it may feel like you have a lot on your shoulders. Some postlabs were done with a partner. Sometimes labs will only make sense if you ask your TA how it's done. IMO Russell is very consistent in not making sense on her directions on labs, so that's when TAs come in to address what's going on (I praise the Chem 20L TAs this quarter shoutout to them). I think labs, in general, are doable if you allow yourself time to do them.Quizzes: I swear quizzes were the only component of the class that didn't stress us out. There was a deadline to do them, but we are given unlimited attempts and she counts the highest score.CPR: The Calibrated Peer Review is a drag to the soul. It's a program that has its own assignments that students must complete, students have to write a text/essay about a certain topic that we have learned (for example, we wrote essays about significant figures, scientific graphs, and titrations). I'm pretty sure these assignments took most students more than a few hours to complete. Besides writing an essay, you would have to go through a calibration, grading and self assessment process. In the end, your grade is based on how other students in the class grade your essay.Midterm: I kinda forgot what happened during the midterm. I remember going ""?????""  in my head though. It was mostly multiple choice and some were free response.Final: all of it was free-response so you had to show your work. the final practice exam was helpful though. For both the midterm and final, how you do your work may be very different to how Russell does the work so keep that in mind.Arlene Russell herself: to the student reading this, you are much better off teaching yourself with the supplemental readings on CCLE, recorded lectures, and your TAs. Russell is somewhat helpful and she is sometimes clear on her instructions. We're allowed to ask her questions on piazza and I remember at one point Russell went M.I.A. on piazza when we had an entire lab due soon. Whenever she did answer questions on piazza, her explanations can be vague, sometimes a little rude and she'll just say ""yes,"" ""no,"" or ""look at *attached message*"" She does upload practice problems for midterms and for the final. She also provides the lab manual on CCLE.As I am writing this I am feeling angry so to finish this review, I started referring her as Arlene instead of Professor Russell.","Spring 2020","A-"

He is extremely responsive to questions, flexible about his office hour times, and truly cares about student learning. During the pandemic learning format, he was willing to drop quizzes entirely from the grading scale and give more points to the homework sections of the grades, and allow us to choose between 1 and 2 midterms as a class. You will not have a professor who is more willing to work with you for the normal CHEM 20A route.-CHEM 20AH as a class itself is quite difficult and definitely brings more to the table than other classes. If you are not well versed in math (up to at least multivariable calculus) and physics (you need to understand vectors and energy), do NOT take this class. While certain classes are listed as corequisites, if you have not taken the relevant math/physics classes, you will have a very hard time. The material is extremely calculation focused, and much time is spent proving concepts numerically that would otherwise just be expected to be memorized in CHEM 20A.-The textbook is quite helpful in helping to understand certain parts of the lecture that weren't as clear, but is certainly not mandatory. Homework takes about 3-6 hours per week, depending on how you feel about the material and math. This does not include studying time and supplemental practice, which you should do a lot of. Discussions are optional but highly recommended; Derek was an excellent TA who covered everything Gelbart didn't get to in lectures. Lectures themselves are also posted on CCLE, including notes, which are very helpful as well.-The midterm and final were both available for 24 hours, though once it started you only had 3 hours to do it. Both time limits felt quite generous, though a tip is to be VERY careful on steps requiring lots of simplification and algebra, as if you have to redo those it will eat up your time. Quizzes were completely dropped and optional due to the pandemic, which was very accomodating. The homework and practice problems provided were extremely similar to the tests, i.e. tests were very fair and of a reasonable difficulty.-Overall, there is practically no reason not to take this class if you need it for a major requirement, unless you are not well-versed in the mentioned math/physics concepts. Even if you're not in the honors college, I would recommend taking CHEM 20AH with Gelbart. If you are in the honors college, well, you found the class to take for your credits! If you look at the grade distribution, despite the difficulty of the class, Gelbart is extremely generous in grading/curving. You'll be much less stressed in this class than others.","Fall 2020","A+"

Initially, the class can seem very difficult just by looking at the syllabus - there are about 4 or 5 presentations, 3 tests, and 3 homework assignments. The class was very small, it is capped at 20 students. While she lectures in depth about plant biochemistry, the exams did not test your knowledge on it directly like the tests you may have taken in previous classes. This class is ALL ABOUT READING RESEARCH PAPERS. The book is crazy detailed, but by all means is unnecessary to take this class. I sat in class and listened but didn't take notes. The presentations are in groups of 2 or 3 and are on selected papers about various studies on plants. The first presentation was a little bit rocky for everyone but we quickly got the hang of it and by the end of class it was a breeze. She is very approachable and nice, and a very good teacher. She will teach you how to dissect research papers, make judgements, and argue/comment on them. She often provides examples applicable to ""real life"" and expands on topics - all to enhance your understanding. She's very interesting and there is a ton to be learned from her. For the exam, you're given a research paper you haven't seen, and a packet of questions to test your understanding on it...and one hour to answer them. Just like the presentations, this became easier as the quarter progressed - showing how our skills have developed. The homework assignments were a bit time consuming, but they weren't too difficult (1.gather research, 2.research on a protein, 3.propose a genetically engineered plant). Like I said, it was my favorite class because of the friendly environment and the skills I actually gained(as opposed to forgetting everything you memorized after the final). We also had a few MOVIE DAYS(on GMO/GE plants), a fun debate day on GMO/GE plants, and on the day we turned in our final homework assignment(on week 10!), she bought us all our OWN custom PIZZA from 800 degrees. I really, really suggest you take this class if you're interested in plants, if you want a small class size, if you want to make a few friends, if you need skills in reading research papers in your career path, and if you like pizza :) Although she probably wont do that every quarter haha.",NA,NA

During lecture,  rather than use pre-made slides, he would write all the material covered in class on his iPad, which was connected to the projector, which allows time for everyone to copy down the notes.  He made lecture very engaging and made funny comments and (oftentimes geeky) jokes, which I appreciated. He really cares about his students learning, and did live stream q and a's every week. The day of the first midterm, a lot of people didn't attend class to study, and Tobolowsky actually went home and recorded a video going over the entire lecture that everyone missed and decided to make midterm days a q and a day instead.

Not once was she able to coherently explain a topic. I am sure she is very intelligent and knowledgeable in her field and her research, but it certainly wasn't communicated through her teaching. Thank God the class was Bruincast because I couldn’t physically sit in that room and listen to her without losing my mind. She's been teaching this class for how many years and still hasn’t bothered to find a way to explain the basics? You will have to do a lot of studying on your own, consulting multiple textbooks and YouTube videos (I recommend UCI and TMP Chem). Her slides were scattered and some lacked important details, while other slides had way too much unnecessary detail. Anything she said in lecture did nothing to explain the slides further, I wouldn’t say she’s mean, but she really wasn’t approachable. This class is supposed to cover so many cool and important topics, and I genuinely feel like I learned nothing. I know it is generally unfair to blame a professor for a bad grade but I’m being serious: Diaconescu ruined any and all passion I had for inorganic chemistry..The worst part is, she knew. She knew she couldn’t teach and she knew you didn’t care. She would straight up admit that the topics are too complicated, so here’s what you need to get an A. And we just kind of accepted that. Funny enough, I can tell her attitude rubbed off on her TAs. I went to both their discussions and they both seemed like they didn’t care about what they were teaching and they didn’t care about you, but they were still way better than Diaconescu herself since they actually put some effort into their lectures..Anyways, as for the class itself:All that being said, you can get by in the end fairly easily. I honestly didn't grasp so many of the concepts but scraped with an A. Two midterms, lowest dropped. Midterm 1 was actually fairly easy, Midterm 2 was significantly harder. Final was really hard and focused heavily on the material after Midterm 2, but of course she won’t tell you that, so don’t bother studying the content before that. Midterm 40%, Final 60%. Be warned she does test on topics that are not in the problem sets. Do NOT be an idiot like me and forget to do the extra credit project (worth 5%). All exams also have some extra credit. The problem sets (not required) were pretty good practice but they were usually too short and lacked detail..So yeah, she actually *does* set up the class so that it’s possible for most people to get an A. Maybe I’m salty because I was too spoiled with past professors who actually gave half a shit. But I could not find one person in our class that even remotely liked her. Unfortunately if you’re reading this review that means she’s the only professor offering the course and you need it to graduate, so I’m sorry. Just another case of a professor that is much more committed to her research than to teaching.","Spring 2019","A"

I guess you can't blame him if he doesn't own a stylus/tablet, but surely with a little effort he could've figured something out.  Another thing that irked me, and maybe this isn't a valid complaint, is that he would constantly ask ""is this clear to you guys? Hello? Hello guys?"" and wouldn't move on unless he got a few replies like""yes makes sense."" I know he was trying to get input but it wasted time on already short lectures when we had to constantly tell him to move on. IMO the etiquette should be to listen if anyone says ""no I don't understand,"" otherwise assume everyone understands. On a more positive note, Henary was very accommodating to the lockdown/protest situation. He apparently made the tests easier for us, which was very nice of him.

First, he wastes a large amount of time doing derivations, only to end with the phrase ""but you won't need to do this on the test."" Second, he never did any example problems in class so it was up to the TA's to do that. (but you could always switch TA's or attend another discussion if yours isn't helpful). Third, he would post helpful practice exams online but refused to post any solutions (so no one was sure if their answers were right).

He is by far the worst professor I have had at UCLA and anyone that says otherwise is lying. For starters, his lectures are absolutely unbearable. All he does is read his notes off a word document and that is about it. You can ask him questions, but unless you are one of his little pets then expect to get a rude remark back. He is so unengaging that more than 2/3rd of the class decided not to watch his lectures live and just watch the recording. I personally had to watch them in x2 speed because he talks so slow that I could renovate my whole room before he reaches to any meaningful part of the lecture. Now lets go into the course content ( spoiler alert: it's not any better). Okay first and foremost, he makes all the students buy a subscription to Thinkwell. ""But surely he has a good reason to do so"" you might say, well you would be wrong. All that anyone does with thinkwell is take the four quizzess he assigns, which is something he could just do on CCLE, but no he would rather lock our grades away behind a paywall. If you genuinely want to learn anything in this class, I recommend you  get a PLF because Scerri will not be helpful. Let us move on his despicable tests. He has the midterm and final, but I can tell you that no matter how long you study for them, you will still be unprepared. Oh and even you do somehow manage to understand his tests, well good luck even finishing them. He is so intent with  making sure student's don't cheat that each question is subdivided into the whole alphabet. So prepared to take on question 1a, 1b, 1c, 1d, 1e, 1f,... you get the idea, and no just because its subdivided does not mean it is any easier. And while it may sound good on paper, for those of us that cannot write or process almost instantaneously, we end up having to suffer because we now have to submit our test with multiple sections left unanswered. Do not even bother trying to talk to him about it because you will get no sympathy from him. If you want to know how he interacts with students, I'll give you a little anecdote:  on week 10 a girl asked him if the review session he was going to have would be recorded. And what did he do? He (very obviously) rolled his eyes and said yes, and then proceeded to interrogate her on  why she would not be able to make it to the live viewing. Mind you this was in front of many other students, and even recorded. When I was watching it, I had to replay it because I was in disbelief that he would dare roll his eyes at a student.  He has a huge ego and it was apparent since day 1. As a professor, he is horrible, but as a person, he is despicable. So, do not listen to these positive reviews on bruinwalk because I have a sneaking suspicion some are TAs trying to get students to take his class. IF YOU CAN AVOID THIS PROFESSOR, DO SO AT ALL COSTS. Trust me, it is NOT worth it. If you happen to have the misfortune of  having him please enroll in a PLF or watch youtube videos on the topics instead because I assure you that you will learn more that way.","Fall 2020","B"

While many professors have adjusted their courses and attitudes to fit the obstacles many students are currently facing, few have been as kind and accommodating as Dr. Casey. There is no other class that students are taking in which the instructional team rejoices in class memes, offers office hours on the weekend, struggles with balloons for our education’s sake and understands, uplifts and encourages all of us to succeed. When I look back on how much we’ve learned over the past quarter, we have done an exceptional amount of learning thanks to the dedication of the instructional team. It is sometimes easy to forget, but at the bare core, professors and TAs do not have a specific obligation to care deeply about student wellbeing or pay an extraordinary amount of detail in creating intentional and meaningful coursework, especially for an online pilot class during a turbulent time in our society! However, Dr. Casey and the TAs/LAs have gone above and beyond in purposefully and passionately fulfilling those additional duties this quarter, all while cultivating a positive environment during class. Dr. Casey mentioned some time during the quarter that in the best case scenario, she hoped that all of us would end the class thinking chemistry is fun. Well, after Chem14AE with her, I’m glad to say that chemistry is fun (most of the time)! Although I personally really like the quarter system, this is one of the few times I actually wish we were on the semester system. This class has been my favorite class I have taken at UCLA so far, and I’m actually sad that it is coming to an end so soon. I’ll miss reading everyone’s responses to the opening question, writing sassy responses on the lab worksheets with my team and feeling just a little more happiness in the world when Dr. Casey’s face lights up in fascination from chiweenies, carrots and random chemistry facts. It even gave me the final push to switch my major to something chem-related. What happens in this course truly is the best of UCLA, and why I love going to this school so much.

This is especially true given that her practice exams are almost exactly like her real exams. It's flexible because it's all based on quizzes or exams - no homework, so no accountability.

If you're a student who learns just as well from textbooks and independent learning, this is a great class because she essentially makes it so that you can do it on your own - especially since she's not an engaging lecturer.In the end my grade breakdown wasQuiz 1: 19/20Quiz 2: 20/20Quiz 3: 20/20Midterm 1: 97/100Midterm 2: 96/100Final: 179/200Total: 431/460 (93.7%) = AEven getting a concussion ~2 weeks before the final and not having gone to class for those 4 weeks (and not keeping up), I was able to do well in the class simply by methodically going through the textbook and doing her practice exams.Chemistry is an intuitive subject for me, but nonetheless I think it was definitely feasible to do well in this class. It's just that most students didn't really have a chem background (including me) and also didn't really know how to study for the class because it's the first in the series. She's fair, but chemistry is just hard for people and her mediocre lecturing probably didn't help. So yeah, it'd be tough if you're not an independent learner, but personally her style actually really worked for me.","Spring 2017","A"

Carlas lectures are scattered and disorganized, making it very difficult to learn and apply the knowledge. Everyone failed the first midterm (average a 64)  and she blamed it on our study habits, not her own INABILITY to relay the information. The way she talks is simply painful to listen to as she talks in scattered sentences. Her handwriting is far from legible, so you'll want to go back and listen to the bruin cast to take your own notes. She told our class we did not need to memorize certain concepts/pathways for the midterm (methionine pathway... just memorize it you'll thank me later) and put them on the midterm anyways (so you cant trust anything she says ). The only way to survive Carlas portion of the class is to  memorize everything, even the stuff she says not to memorize.

However, they are final.  Grades cannot be changed; no matter how much you whine or beg. "".Whine or beg. These are the words she uses to address her class. I have never met such an arrogant, rude, and downright unpleasant person in my life. Let me put the personality complaints aside and tell you about the exams. The first exam was incredibly easy with a median score of 84%. Being so high, she sends us an email about how she is surprised and essentially wants/expects a lower average. We all get very nervous for the second exam, so we study very hard to prepare. Boom, second exam results come in and the average is a 50% with a HIGHEST SCORE of a 72%. The exam was IMPOSSIBLE to do well on, and was obviously designed for students to fail (hence the average). She comes into the class smiling the next day, without any sort of apology for such a terrible exam. I knew it was completely on purpose to lower the overall average grades of the class. Final exam was not so bad with an average of a 73%. A 90% overall grade was the A cutoff..The course was rather boring and uninteresting. The material was super easy until the end of the second midterm material where it suddenly picked up and was way too fast. She decided to lecture a massive amount of material in week 10 when our final was on Sunday (so Friday lecture was tested on in depth less than 2 days later). She never told us anything about what we were expected to know for exams except ""look at the learning outcomes."" This was hugely misleading since none of the learning outcomes for a particular section said we would be required to draw the mechanism of RNA splicing, but there it is on the 50 minute midterm. She was so unclear on what we had to know that we would spend hours memorizing meaningless details that were never tested on..The curve in this class is extremely weak. You barely get 3-4% grade boost at the B+/A levels. With a midterm of 50% average. Tell me how this is fair to the students. Clearly, she does not care about her students and is teaching purely for a paycheck and to banter to her top 2 favorite students about how women scientists don't get recognized for Nobel prizes..If you can avoid her, then BY ALL MEANS steer clear. Her course is boring, unforgiving in terms of grades at the B+/A levels, and she doesn't show any care for her students' success. She wrote a midterm to be impossible on purpose to bring her class average down because she simply doesn't want to give out more than 20% A's.

I spent countless hours  writing my lab reports and was docked down for literally the dumbest shit. A person can follow the exact prompt that was given to them to the T but it really doesn’t make a difference. They look for very specific things in the reports and you basically have to just figure out what that is, if not you will get marked down significantly. There were two test that were administered this quarter, the first one was quite easy but the second was largely focused on information that was barely mentioned in class. Let me just say, that I’m all for professors assigning people tough lab reports, and giving out challenging exams that force you to think critically, but as a professor you should make the class curved then if you’re going to make the class this hard. The point system in this class made it a million times more stressful than it had to be and I do not feel like the grade I received was at all a reflection of the knowledge that I extracted from the course.  DO NOT BELIEVE THE GRADE DISTRIBUTIONS IN THIS CLASS, the majority of people do NOT gets As. Bottom line if you want an A take a different Professor. And if you must take this class do so with a very light course load and treat every point like it’s gold. The TAs in this class are basically given god like authority over a persons grade and if they are anything like the one I had, they will dock you for the most minuscule shit.

While many professors have adjusted their courses and attitudes to fit the obstacles many students are currently facing, few have been as kind and accommodating as Dr. Casey. There is no other class that students are taking in which the instructional team rejoices in class memes, offers office hours on the weekend, struggles with balloons for our education’s sake and understands, uplifts and encourages all of us to succeed. When I look back on how much we’ve learned over the past quarter, we have done an exceptional amount of learning thanks to the dedication of the instructional team. It is sometimes easy to forget, but at the bare core, professors and TAs do not have a specific obligation to care deeply about student wellbeing or pay an extraordinary amount of detail in creating intentional and meaningful coursework, especially for an online pilot class during a turbulent time in our society! However, Dr. Casey and the TAs/LAs have gone above and beyond in purposefully and passionately fulfilling those additional duties this quarter, all while cultivating a positive environment during class. Dr. Casey mentioned some time during the quarter that in the best case scenario, she hoped that all of us would end the class thinking chemistry is fun. Well, after Chem14AE with her, I’m glad to say that chemistry is fun (most of the time)! Although I personally really like the quarter system, this is one of the few times I actually wish we were on the semester system. This class has been my favorite class I have taken at UCLA so far, and I’m actually sad that it is coming to an end so soon.  I’ll miss reading everyone’s responses to the opening question, writing sassy responses on the lab worksheets with my team and feeling just a little more happiness in the world when Dr. Casey’s face lights up in fascination from chiweenies, carrots and random chemistry facts. It even gave me the final push to switch my major to something chem-related.  What happens in this course truly is the best of UCLA, and why I love going to this school so much.

He speeds at a breakneck pace through a vast array of material without giving any context as to how concepts relate to each other or why we should care. Additionally, his lecture slides are spotted with typos and are almost entirely useless to review afterwards, so you need to take expansive notes. On the positive side, the Owl homework is very forgiving, and is a substantial part of your final grade. I learned pretty much nothing through the majority of the class, and had to frantically study outside materials and previous tests to make any measurable progress as tests drew near.

Through all of this, Scerri speeds on, unconcerned with the fact that 90% of the students have no real clue what's going on.Anyway, the long and the short of it is this: avoid Scerri if humanly possible, especially if you are not strong in chemistry coming in.

Due to Yoffe's intelligence, he goes on explaining concepts in poor detail and does not talk about the assumptions he makes. I will be fair, the first three weeks of this class that had partial derivatives was an absolute nightmare, but by around week five, his lectures became significantly better so hats off to him for that. Regardless, even after his improvements, he continued to teach material poorly. What bothers me about Yoffe the most is not his teaching ability but rather his attitude. During office hours and even lecture he would make rude, sarcastic, arrogant comments when students asked questions and did not handle himself professionally. His office hours are okay but it's hard to show up when your intelligence as an upper division biochemistry student and the best public university in the world is constantly being ridiculed. His TA Chen was terrible and would mutter as he wrote equations on the board. Even after getting terrible TA reviews last quarter, Yoffe continued to let him teach. The other TA KJ was amazing. Although even she was sometimes confused, she was clear about the knowledge she could provide you. Outside of little things like Yoffe constantly showing up late to class and erasing the chalkboard before you could even write everything down, his exams were poor. He emailed us that Jule Thompson Expansion wouldn't be on the midterm when there were then conceptual questions about it. During week 2 I wrote in my notes because he explicitly stated only Pressure Volume work would be tested but on the final, he brings out tension work out of nowhere. Yoffe's curriculum is also lackluster. Although he has taught this class before and at community college, the homework questions often do not provide you with all the information you need, they are often irrelevant and do not prepare you for the exams, and you are not prepared to answer them with what you have learned in lecture. People who get the best grades on the homework are those who have Chegg accounts or money to buy online homework services, not kids who start the homework early.  Yoffe lectures based off of another professor's notes, tells us to read the textbook and the other professor's notes. Between three different sources of information and a variety of handouts and emails that Yoffe constantly sends (I've received more than a 100 emails from this buffoon this quarter), it is hard to understand what you need to know for the exam and what is trivial.  Yoffe also doesn't even seem to take his own final seriously because his phone went off multiple times in the middle of the exam. Yoffe is a physical chemistry genius and has a true passion for thermodynamics, but he has no business teaching students due to his poor curriculum, attitude, and inability to handle things logistically. 110A is a tough class, especially for people who will never use it again in their lives, but having a professor who can teach, can make this class which some consider the hardest one in the biochem major, much more tolerable.","Winter 2019",NA

A concrete example is that, whenever I get answers to questions he raises wrong in class, Prof. Bouchard consistently used discouraging words like “Wrong” and “No” and did not let me continue answering the question, whereas he treats other student with much more patience, using words like “try harder” or “thinker deeper” while waiting for their answers.

Also she gives you her lecture notes so you don't have to buy a course reader and she provides food at her OH and review sessions. She explained concepts well in both her lectures and OHs. Homework mainly consisted of a few problems and biweekly problem sets, which were not very time consuming. Exams are very straightforward and you should do well if you do as much of her practice material as possible (Problems Sets, Practice Self Evaluations, Recommended Textbook Problems, examples from TA discussions etc.). Even though they don't count toward your grade, I recommend doing or at least looking over her recommended textbook problems since doing so will help you better understand concepts and I've noticed usually 1 problem on the exam that resembles a textbook problem.

The exams are almost identical to the practice problems. He's had plenty of experience teaching g-chem to underclassmen, so he knows what he's doing. He also doesn't use Oxtoby that much (which is a real plus, because I personally think that Oxtoby is one of the most difficuly textbooks to learn chem out of if you don't have any chem experience)One negative I would point out is that the class is very competitive.

The course consisted of weekly negotiations for participation, case summaries based on in-class debriefs and the textbook, an article summary, and a final capstone exercise. The class met once a week, and during each class, we would be assigned a random partner to act out a negotiation with different instructions and then debrief altogether afterwards. It was very intimidating at first because there were some realtors and lawyers in our class. Fortunately, I was paired with people who were at the same negotiation-skill level as me, so I had a good experience. It was definitely a unique, low-risk environment to practice these skills, and my favorite case was the one where I was a movie director trying to meet my targets. The case summaries were not too difficult to complete, but you want to make sure you are being clear in the way you integrate concepts from the textbook and class. For the article summary assignment given at the end of class, Dr. Johnson gave us articles to select and write about. It was not too difficult because the article I chose was interesting to me. The final capstone exercise was a little more work because I had to meet with my group and develop a negotiation strategy and plan outside of class time. We also had to find time with the other negotiation group outside of class to act out our negotiation. In addition, our TA, Jessica Shropshire, was also very available and helpful. Overall, Negotiation is one of the most practical classes you can take here at UCLA (it is similar to a graduate level MBA negotiation course), and Dr. Johnson is a very personable instructor that truly cares about what her undergraduate students are taking away from her teachings.","Winter 2021","A"

He also seemed to be intrigued by our experiments and findings just as much as we were, which I thought was sweet. Highly recommend taking it as a fun addition to Comm 10!","Fall 2023","A"

Here's the deal - this class was disorganized but overall the content was great. Every week Prof. Hammer brought in at least one guest speaker (often times two) and they would lead presentations and discussions based on the media assignments for the week (screenwriters, critical media literacy experts, journalists, etc.). The media assignments were usually a mix of documentaries, some movies, and a bit of reading (though cannot stress enough, really not that much reading). To be honest, you don't need to do the media viewings because a lot of the conversation is guided by general ideas and opinions more than breaking down media texts, but Prof. Hammer was always very excited when people could draw connections to specifically assigned texts. TBH, I have no idea what comprises my grade in this class. Prof. Hammer did not have a clear syllabus prepared and it was a bit shrouded throughout the entire quarter (usually she hands out printed paper w the next week's assignments?), I think (?) that our final project was worth 50% (with 10% being a final paper), and participation was the rest. If you don't like not knowing what is going on and having a clear sense of assignments/timelines, this may not be the course for you. The final project is a group presentation or video, you make groups on the first day and can explore any topic you want related to race, class, gender, sexuality, etc. Some of the projects from our class ranged from explorations of CompHet to depictions of Disney Villains that promoted racist and ableist rhetoric. Overall very interesting and prompted great class discussion. You have the entire quarter to work on your project but most of it is outside of the course - I recommend starting early and just getting it done. At the end of the day, it seems clear that Prof. Hammer really just wants everyone to have an engaging experience and lead meaningful conversations, but her communication style (ironic for a comm class lol) is a bit confusing and her online communication often did not make a ton of sense. But, she is a lovely person and promotes a wonderful class environment. With only about 20 students, I found myself fully able to really engage in discussions and talk about a lot of deeply personal issues like body image and sexuality comfortably - the class environment was wonderful. BOTTOM LINE - go to class and put some effort in, you will be totally fine. Expect most but not all classes will take the entire 3-hour period.","Winter 2023","A"

Chris is hands down one of the best professors I have ever had, and this is one of the most interesting classes I have ever taken- I took it almost 2 years ago and still remember a lot of the material, both because of how great of a lecturer Chris is and because of how applicable the material is to everyday life. His lectures are always interesting, he shows movie clips to illustrate a lot of the topics and he gives extremely light reading (usually one reading per lecture, they take 10-20 minutes to read, and they're usually pretty interesting).One thing to keep in mind with lectures is that even though he posts the Power Points, you're really getting 99% of the information you need in lecture, so you actually have to go and take notes. The good thing is that his lectures are all interesting and he will repeat definitions, important points, etc. multiple times, so you're never struggling to get down what you need (and there's never too much to get down per lecture- I hand wrote my notes and it was maybe 1&1/2 to 2 pages front and back per lecture, if even that much). Also, even though participation isn't part of your grade, you actually do have to participate sometimes, but he lets you know in advance (usually he'll show a movie clip or pass out papers for something you'll do in class and he tells people by rows what to look out for). Don't be afraid to ask questions in lecture if you need to.Grade is broken down as follows: 3 quizzes, 2 short papers and a final (he also gave an extra credit opportunity at the end of the quarter). With the papers, he has about 20 topics to choose from that are due throughout the quarter, just pick the 2 you're most interested in and turn them in before their deadlines. He also breaks down what he's looking for in the papers in the beginning of the quarter, so don't stress them too much, he wants you to do well. Last thing is that it sometimes takes a few days for him to respond to emails because he gets so many, so if you have a question about one of the papers make sure you don't send it last minute.Seriously, TAKE HIS CLASS IF YOU HAVE THE CHANCE.","Fall 2017","A+"

That being said it's not like this stuff needs to be updated because I'm not sure how much it really changes, but the class just felt like it was being recycled.

I lost interest in doing so (for reasons unrelated to this class) around the second half of the quarter and felt like I was wasting so much time and energy to do well since I couldn't drop or P/NP. Anyway, the first half of the class was on interpersonal communication and I found the content pretty interesting. I was excited for the second half (on mass communication) but it was DREADFUL, like so boring that I stopped listening to the lectures and, instead, skimmed the lecture transcript for information related to the key points in the lecture guides. The essay was kinda fun since you are encouraged to exclusively use your experience and observations. I wrote about the ""politics"" of kissing in American culture, completed it in a day's time, and did fairly well on it. If you really resonate with an essay topic and dedicate a couple of days to it you shouldn't have that hard of a time writing it. The midterm and final were straightforward and open note, so if you take decent notes and study a bit you will probably be fine. The midterm consisted of ~29 short response questions (~50% related to lecture content, ~50% related to assigned articles) and two long response questions (one on lecture content, the other on Tannen book), where the final consisted of ~26 short response questions (mostly related to lecture/assigned articles with a few on Price book) and three long response questions (two on lecture content, the other on Jones book). I didn't really prepare for either of the exams except for making all my notes and the readings easily accessible (AKA Ctrl-F-able). So if you're taking this online, digitize EVERYTHING.

This class was also a lot of work for no reason and she sorta graded a little bit hard on discussion posts which was basically another paper on Black Mirror episodes. You have to write two papers; the first paper is about a film you choose from and the second paper is with a partner and you both get the same grade.

There are two tests: the midterm was very lengthy and difficult because it was so open ended, but being able to review this test before the final helped a ton. The final incorporated similar questions from the midterm and some VERY BASIC stats that we learned in the 2nd half of the class.  We could use Excel on our final for the stats portion.

Some of the concepts are quite interesting at a high level. Lu does make an effort to go into the psychology and studies behind different phenomenon but this being a UCLA Econ class most of it will be pointless and functionally useless math models that impart no understanding.

The faculty advice would often be conflicting but that’s business for you. What is annoying is that this class is taught by Econ people rather than business people and it shows. We were told how great what we were doing was the whole way through until the judges (entrepreneurs themselves) tore it up because it lacked any real substance beyond buzzwords and generality.

Dont read the textbook before she goes over her slides because she skips certain sections (the hard ones) so the best way to study is the slides. It is certainly possible to come into the final with an 100%. The grading was 25% a midterm which I got a 95 on and was super easy, it was also 10% going to discussion and  15% this graph project which was also super easy to get a 100 on if you follow the rubric and took me only 1 hour to do the entire thing. The final also wasnt hard but it requires that you study. Final also wasnt cumulative which was nice. Final and midterm consist of vocab, multiple choice and some short answer which are really easy if you look over the graphs. Going to lecture is important because she explains everything really well but if you were to skip lecture youd be fine teaching yourself.  Also she has office hours which usually dont get busy so if youre confused she can try to teach it again.

Professor Lleras-Muney is such a nice and of course, knowledgeable professor. Her lectures are enjoyable for the most part (although I admit watching them at 2X speed after they were posted), but the biggest issue for this class was simply time. The midterm was very time constraint and there was simply too many questions that required a lot of explanations. Partial credit was generously given, but also taken away too easily.  She had practice exams posted with the solutions and the solutions themselves were essay long answers. She did clarify that she was not expecting those kind of answers, that it was mostly to be complete, but that's what it felt like for the midterm.  She was kind enough to add 9 points to our raw score so at least she saw that the expectations were a little too high. Another major point that is not emphasized enough in the previous reviews are group work. Super time consuming and you absolutely need to have at least one person in the group be comfortable with R, Stata, or whatever coding program you're using. This class is basically like a writing class because every group work assignment requires at least a 3 page memo. Now, this sounds easy, but she posts an outline of what she wants with a bunch of questions and most are very broad so you kinda have to pick and choose. It feels like you need to evaluate which are the most important questions and then supplement it with the correct graphs, etc. Presentations are not too bad, but the data problems and memos are very tedious so make sure your group is on top of things since assignments are due Friday @ 9am. The final..... so because of the midterm, she decided to make the final ""take-home"" aka she gave the final ahead of time & about a week and two days to do it. It was extremely time consuming and long. Depending on how many people you were working with (max 3), you had to answer at least 2 questions each worth 100 points.One part was a 4 page essay, the second part was a 5 page data report memo, and the third part was mathematical computations (which were not even taught directly in class so you had to figure that out on your own). So, overall, I guess you just had to pick your poison and pick which two (or three if you were 3 people) parts you wanted to do. While it was super long, the scores and final grades were pretty high so it paid off. This class is definitely not a class you can just put in the back of your head since each week you have group work and presentations.  The material is interesting which is a plus, and it's very relevant to how the government works and current economic policies. It's a nice change from theoretical classes that rely on models and formulas. This is a great class and you really do learn a lot from it, just be ready to spend a lot of time on busy work and presentations!","Fall 2020","A"

My group put in minimal effort on the assignment, presented it nicely, and got more than full marks (4/3)Midterm: The midterm was easy as well; all multiple choice, with some hard questions and some easy questions. His practice midterms were a very good indicator of the questions on the midterm. With extra credit, I also received over 100% on the midterm.Final: The final is where this entire class went to hell very quickly. I studied all of his practice finals and did every single question, but the final was impossibly difficult. My grade in the class plummeted from an A+ to a B just because of the final exam. I still love Copic, but I did not love his final. If you take this class with him, beware.","Fall 2015","B"

I think I would have done better if I had just worked out of the textbook and done example problems from there, because his slides don't really help you learn how to do the mathematical problems you later see on his exams. Convery is great about providing practice problems--he puts up problem sets for every chapter that is covered, as well as provides sample midterms and finals for you to work on (all with answers included). He holds review sessions before each test--which were of no use to me, but maybe some people got more out of them.

I understand that they used the Mindtap app for practice MCQ questions in the past years but this year it was discontinued because it was too expensive.

At the end of the course, it was revealed that only slightly above 20% of students received some sort of an A. This means that you can literally score in the upper quartile and still not even receive an A-. And I have heard that in the past quarters, the professor has curved the class down before. If everyone is working hard and doing well in your (very difficult) class, I don't know why a professor would want to punish students by deflating their grades.I also wanted to talk about the professor. While he is very enthusiastic, social, and friendly to the students, he also will not make it easy for you to succeed. What do I mean by this? He habitually posts problem sets days after he says he will in the syllabus and still expects you to turn it in on the original due date (which could end up being less than two days after it is posted). Sometimes, he will teach a concept to you using very simple examples and then expect you to make leaps of knowledge in the homework or on the test. This was especially true on the final, which was not only inhumanely long but had questions on it that hardly related to what was being taught in class at all. I genuinely believe that if it weren't for my TA, I would have gotten a 50% on all the homeworks alone. Furthermore, the professor will post ""practice"" problems for you on the tests the day before the tests and also not give you an answer key. What is the point of posting practice problems if you can't even check your work?Finally, I wanted to talk about the lab component to this class, which was supposedly graded ""on completion"" and that everyone would do well in. There was absolutely no standard for how your grade in that class will be determined, and there was very little clarity as to what sort of presentation they wanted us to make.This review may come off as overly bitter, and honestly it is. I know that the 106 series is supposed to be harder than the rest of the econ electives, but you can still do yourself a favor and try to take easier ones. I heard pricing and strategy is pretty fun. You may think that you are good at game theory (like I did before I took this class) but unless you are okay with the possibility of actually putting a lot of effort into a class and still struggling to get a B, I would not recommend taking this class.","Spring 2023","C+"

Especially during all the chaos with the pandemic/BLM protests, he was super understanding and tried to make the best out of the situation. His lectures are very clear, and he goes through a ton of examples to really solidify the content (side note:  he REALLY listens to student feedback; he adjusted the difficulty of the 2nd midterm/final after looking over the results of the 1st midterm, for example).  He sometimes holds review sessions before exams, and a TON of extra office hours during midterm and final season (use them)! The material of econ 11 is obviously very challenging--the class is a weeder for a reason--but Prof. Goncalves is an absolute gem of the econ department.

Not a good sign, right? She then proceeded to present disorganized lectures in mildly broken English and expected us to understand every single piece of information she gave.The exams were my least favorite part of the class. The final was cumulative, so we were expected to know an ungodly amount of information about a WIDE variety of topics. She actually told us that we needed to know everything we had learned in class. Literally everything (?). But once I actually saw the final, it became clear that she was only testing us on MAYBE 10% of the material covered in class, and she wanted SPECIFIC answers.

As a result, she sometimes ended her lectures earlier than expected but was not willing to give the next topic because she ""didn’t prepare it"".When we tried to ask questions, she would rudely disrupt us and basically repeat what she had already said. When the class was too quiet, she complained to us about students who suggested the class be more interactive in previous course evaluations and questioned us ""how could the class be interactive if you don’t ask anything?"" She forgot to record lectures and instead emailed us that she ""didn’t have pockets or belts to put the microphone’s base"" so she would not record any more.When a student asked her if we had to rent a class content documentary, she sent out an email in which she compared the price of the documentary with the average price of LA’s cappuccino to prove that we should be able to cover the cost.Like many of the others who took this class, I did so because of the grade distribution. I did well in this class because, to be honest, this class was pure memorization. Despite that, she had two midterms, and the second was even cumulative.

The midterm and final are comprised with computational problems, 5 true/false and a few conceptual questions. The grading scheme is 55% HW, 20% Midterm and 25% Final. Even though it is a graduate course, it doesn't have a curve so you need a 93%+ for an A. Anderson is a pretty nice guy and always open to help. I would definitely take another class with him. I only went to lectures for the first half of the quarter because I got tired of waking up for 9ams.

Less than a week turnaround for both exam scores. The exams itself are both 50 minutes (midterm around week 5 and final friday week 10). They are very fair and everyone seems to do well on them. The homework took a while for me but that's because I didn't go to lectures nor knew how to code that well (first time coding in MATLAB).

He provides practice exams on BruinLearn, which are excellent representations of what the actual exam will be like (especially pay attention to the topics covered on the practice exam, they are almost always the same as what will be on the real exam), and there is enough time to finish them if you know what you're doing. Review the material and actual study, and you will be fine. There are also quizzes on Gradescope that need to be completed before each class, but they involve only reading parts of the textbook and can be done in ~5 minutes (just use Control - F).-->The grade calculation is as such:15% pre-class quizzes (3 lowest are dropped, eg. if you forgot or were out of town)20% homework (graded for completion, the lowest one is dropped)","Fall 2022","A"

Very interesting class, and Will is great, but I was not expecting this class to involve what it did. Will is a great lecturer and very accommodating. He will do these marathon review sessions for each exam that are very helpful. He also made the decision to let us use a double sided formula sheet for the final and a scientific calculator (get one that has a “mod” function or “remainder” function on it). He’s also extremely fair with grades. I struggled a lot in this class and still got a B- so that should hopefully encourage you. I will say though, if you’re going to take this class, get good at number theory (modular arithmetic, prime numbers, etc), Python, and maybe some Abstract Algebra (MATH 110A, 110B and maybe even 110C) before you take this class. The only prerequisite for this class is MATH 115A (Linear Algebra), but I think you should know how to use Python, maybe have taken MATH 11N, MATH 111, MATH 110A, MATH 110B, or some number theoretical algebraic class or lots of self study on it. I would imagine if the wrong professor taught this class (Will is great, so not him) students would be in for a rude awakening drowning in Python homework and a bunch of number theory that they never learned. You also get three grading schemes and an optional final paper/project you can submit at the end of the class on a topic of your choice regarding cryptology stuff, ranging from more abstract mathematical stuff to more applied, concrete examples like the Enigma machine or blockchain (he advises against blockchain cause it’s very advanced and easy to mess up). So, I’d say if you’re really good with Number Theory, Algebra, Python, and maybe just math in general, you’ll really enjoy this class. If those things are brand new to you like it was for me, I think you’ll still be okay, but you’ll hurt a little bit lol. I’m still really glad I took the class. One of the most interesting, stimulating classes I’ve ever taken here at UCLA. Probably wouldn’t take again until I took MATH 11N, MATH 110A and MATH 111.","Winter 2024","B-"

She's really nice and caring, and I like her positive energy. I wish I had the chance to take her in person. Her class and lectures are very organized.  The pacing of the class was good because we were able to cover everything she wanted to from the syllabus, though we did deviate from the syllabus a little since she wanted to talk about Bitcoin $$$. She's alright during lecture, but sometimes I'll get lost since I have no idea what she's talking about. And she's extremely confusing when she's doing a proof. One time she did a proof from the homework during office hours and I copied her proof onto my homework and when my homework got graded, I lost points since there were flaws in the proof. :( Perhaps I would avoid taking a proofs class with her if you can. It helps to read the textbook because it's sometimes better than her notes.Hsu takes into consideration feedback from the students. We filled out two surveys during the quarter. At first, the workload was a little heavy, but someone complained about the workload on Piazza so the homework assignments gradually got cut down to about 3-5 problems. Most of the problems will come from the textbook. There will be some problems with tedious calculations like calculate 23^3 * 19^5 * 11^4 (mod 97). We're required to do some problems by hand, and some problems using Sage. She'll provide the Sage instructions on the homework but it's usually straightforward. You don't need coding experience to do well in this class. We had 9 homework assignments this quarter (1 homework / week... we had a homework due during finals week :( ). I appreciate that she published the homework solutions to every assignment.Her exams are straightforward, given the online setting. This is probably my only online math class where I thought all the exams were possible to complete in the suggested time of 1 hour for the midterm and 3 hours for the final. Both of the midterms consisted of about 3 multiple choice questions and  2-3 fill in the blank which are the conceptual questions that I usually would get incorrect. The rest of the exam is mostly 4 computational questions, and 1 proof question. The proof question is alright, and it's easier than the proofs from the homeworks. The averages on the midterms were in the 90s, which is to be expected since the questions were mostly computational. I would imagine the exams to be harder in person since there's a lot of algorithms to memorize and I don't know if she'll let you use your notes. The algorithms aren't hard to perform, but it might be hard to memorize all the steps. I scored well on the exams but I think I would get a much lower score if I had to take the exams in person because I would not remember all the algorithms and cryptosystems. If you are good at memorization, then you will do well when taking the in-person exams.I don't think it's absolutely necessary to have taken 115a before this class. We did a section on lattices which did involve linear algebra, but if you have taken 33a, you should be fine. However, I think you should have some exposure to proofs. Some homeworks will have 1-3 proofs in it, and you should expect a proof on the exams. Also maybe it could help to have exposure to algebra (110a) but it's not necessary since this class doesn't assume any algebra knowledge. I haven't taken 110a and I still did well. You should expect to do lots of modular arithmetic in this class. At times, this class felt more like a number theory/algebra class than a cryptography class. This class makes me bored sometimes but I would recommend this class if you have some interest in cryptography.","Spring 2021","A"

His homework ranges in difficulty with some homework set taking 2-3 hours and others taking upwards to 6-7. I frequently went to his office hours and he is more than happy to explain concepts. Also, he is very accommodating and often made up office hours if something ever came up. If you are experiencing difficulty with the homework, I definitely recommend using the Student Math Centre and I went there almost every week if I had questions with the homework. He also uses Piazza (online forum) which made answering questions really easy. Discussion is required for part of the grade and only 5%. I honestly did not find my TA super engaging but having a stellar TA is not a huge factor for his course. The difficulty of his exams and final are very comparable and are on the same difficulty as the homework (if not easier). As a result, averages for the exam are pretty high (80%+) and with 40 point exams, there is very little room for careless mistakes. Rubin gave us extra credit on the final but I wouldn't expect extra credit. In terms of the actual material, there is a lot to unpackage and ranges from sets and functions to counting to graphs and trees.

Firstly, his class was very fair. All our exams had problems similar to the homework, so earning a good grade was a matter of being diligent and doing all your assignments. Also, the reviews that talk about him being a terrible lecture are totally untrue, in my opinion – there are times where he goes a little bit too fast, but he always answers questions during lecture and overall does a good job keeping everyone on task. The only thing I'm concerned about is learning – since we had open note + open internet exams, I did feel like I didn't learn as much from the exams.

Please keep in mind that this review is coming from somebody who breezed through AP Calculus AB and BC in high school, got 5’s on both of the tests, and absolutely loves mathematics.  If you happen to take this class with Chayes as opposed to any other professor, you are intentionally making the class over 15 times more difficult.  Lest you think I am exaggerating,  the content on both his homework and tests is on material absolutely not necessary for a regular 32A class, such as Convex Sets, LaPlace Equations in polar form, and in general, the hardest math problems I have ever seen in a math class.  I have several friends in 32A with different professors who are less mathematically savvy than me and tell me they are breezing through their 32A classes with different professors.  Know that I have heard of people who took advanced math at the 32A level or higher, and got worse grades than me in this course with this specific professor.  Please listen to me when I say this: you are intentionally making the class 10-15 times harder if you choose Chayes as your professor for 32A.  Aside from the ridiculous level of difficulty found in his problems, his lectures are extremely unclear and do not help at all.  I learned nearly 100% of the concepts in this course from an online YouTube professor named Professor Leonard.  Prof. Chayes taught me almost no concepts in this class that I ended up using on the exams.  So if you take this class, it is almost 100% certain that you will be relying HEAVILY on outside help, whether it be TAs or online videos, as in my case.  I can only think of one scenario in which you should willingly take 32A with Chayes, and that is if you are a Pure Math Major with goals of becoming a Math Researcher/Professor as a career in the future, and are willing to put lots of time and effort into this class.  But EVEN if this is the case for you, I would still be very cautious as to entering this class, as the amount of difficulty in this class combined with the almost complete inability of the Professor to help you makes for an unpleasant experience in which you will have to rely on outside help almost completely, as in my case.  It was only through complete reliance on YouTube and working through difficult homework problems with help from friends and the TA and some luck that I managed to get an A in this class.  In 99% of cases, I would highly recommend that you do not take this Professor.  If you are stuck in this class and can not drop it, I will give you survival strategies which helped me get an A in this very difficult class:1.  Don’t doubt yourself.  This class is harder than BC Calculus, and it’s perfectly normal that you’re struggling with it.  But believe that you can work through the problems.2.  Do NOT over-estimate your mathematical ability because you breezed through AP Calculus in high school and got 5’s on the AP exams.  This was my case initially, and it led to an unpleasant experience in the class.3.  DO seek outside help in the class as soon as you can, whether it be from a TA, tutoring, or YouTube (for me, Professor Leonard helped a lot)4. DO meet others in your class lecture/discussion and form a study group; it helps tremendously to work through the problems with others5.  Spend lots of time trying to understand the hardest problems on the homework; if you can get through the hardest homework problems with relative ease, then you will ace your exams.  It’s just that the hardest homework problems are tremendously difficult.","Fall 2019","A"

To start with, he knows what he is teaching and doesn't rely on slides except when he needs to check on his notes for examples. He shows steps for solving each type of problems and is clear on the methods, both algebraically and geometrically. His final is admittedly significantly harder than the homeworks (by the way, he gives a lot of homeworks and the last one consisted of 53 questions due the day before finals so remember this) but I personally think the test overall is well made. You can't solve those problems by simply plugging numbers into equations, this is, at least for me, how a test should look like. I missed something on the final also, but I still think it is well designed.  On thing for me, however, the final is definitely longer than it should be, and I had to ask many clarifying questions regarding what the problems mean so spaces of improvements here. Like you shouldn't except students to think hard for a consecutive 3 hours cause many problems do explain some depth of thinking. Also, Siddarth should consider what topic to put on midterms and finals.

If you do the work and understand the logic of it well, the quizzes will be easy; don't complete the homework, you're screwed for that quiz.

I found his approach to be, while sometimes overbearing, more helpful in the long run than other math professors.Your grade will consists primarily of homework, two midterms, and one final, all of which will be posted on Gradescope. The homework consists of textbook problems and his own personal problems; the textbook problems will be a breeze, while his problems will require a bit more thinking. His midterms are mostly easy computational problems with a few problems testing your conceptual knowledge. His final is also similar, but consists of more conceptual problems; none of his exams are super difficult, but it wouldn't be fair to say that they are a breeze either.Karthik's method of lecturing initially began with lecturing on the blackboard, but he switched to slides after our review and inputs, which worked out much better. He does go a little too quickly with his slides, but asking him to go a few slides back will generally get him to slow a bit. Other than that, his lectures are fairly standard; they get the material across, and that's about it. You learn. That's what you're here for anyways.Overall, Karthik left a really bad impression in his first few weeks, but improved immensely over the next few weeks, making him one of the few professors at UCLA that actually adapt to his students rather than the other way around. I suspect that he'll continue using slides in the future, and that he'll mellow out and became a better lecturer by next quarter. I would rate him a 3/5 overall for now, but note that he will probably become better as time goes on.PS: Karthik really cares about his students, but he does send out a rather excessive amount of emails pertaining to important information.

Through talking about the big picture about professor Huang, her grading scheme, grading standard, lectures, homework, etc., this review may help you decide whether you should take or continue on this class or not.-About Grading Scheme: 25% Homework + 25% Quizzes + 20% Midterm + 30% Final. OR 25% Homework + 25% Quizzes + 50% Final, Professor will eventually choose the higher one among these two that calculate towards your final grade, which means it is possible to miss the midterm and increase the proportation of weigh of you final. There is also 1% bonus point on your final grade if you do the evaluation at the end of the quarter. For the quiz and homework parts, professor will drop 2 lowest homework scores from the 7 homework scores, and drop 2 lowest quizzes grades from the 7 quiz grades. Initially the A cutoff is 93, but professor Huang said the grades may be curved according to the absolute perfomance of the entire class, so no need to worry about the 93cutoff.-About Midterm: There is only one in-class 50-minute-long midterm that takes up 20% of your final grade. The time of the midterm is quite late in the quarter (roughly week7) and will cover the topics mentioned on the studyguide. Professor Huang always give us a studyguide for exams, including midterm and finals, which are extremely helpful. Make sure that you understand every single question on the studyguide. Midterm is overall fair, consist of 4 , where the difficulty of midterm questions are very similar to the homework questions, relatively easy in general.-About Final: The final is absolutely a disaster, and is the only challenge throughout the entire quarter. Those final exam questions are far harder than the homework sets, and are not similar to the studyguide questions at all. Those unbearbly difficult questions make the average of the final drop to 58.8%, where the midterm average is about 76%. If you do not study very very hard for the final, spend enough time practicing studyguide questions, you might get screwed on the final. I'm a math-major student and still spend 60 hours in the previous week before the final to practice, and I still think the final is VERY DIFFICULT. Both midterm and final questions are not the same questions you did in homework or in discussion, while I heard some other professors use exactly the same hw questions on exams. So if you are not that confident with your performance in this extremely challenging final, try other professors' sessions instead.-About Quizzes: There are in total 7 quizzes throughout the quarter, starting from week 3 to week 10 (midterm week no quiz). The lowest 2 quizzes will be dropped. These weekly quizzes are very easy, which are 10-minutes-long conducted during discussion sessions every Thursday, consist 1 proof questions. All these question come directly from the homeworks, and are exactly the same questions. If you do the homework, then this should be just easy pz for you.-About Homeworks: There are in total 7 homework sets in total. The lowest 2 homework grades will be dropped. Each homework set consist of 2 sections: The first section is the graded question section, this is the one that will be graded, which consist of 3 questions from the text book. The second section is suggested question section (not graded, no need to write down), which is made up of lots of suggested homework questions from the text book assigned by the professor, which are helpful for exams. Doing the suggested part before exams can really help you do better. Overall, the weekly graded section of the homework should take you less than an hour.-About Lectures: All the lectures this quarter are podcasted and posted on Bruinlearn website. Professor Huang also posted notes for every lecture on the website as well, which are very helpful. During the lecture time, all professor did was writing the notes, so it is possible for you not go to the lecture at all (I went to the lecture only once this quarter) by just reading the notes/read textbooks/watch recordings. You can choose from either one of these approaches. Perosnally I think Professor Huang has a very thick accent, so it might be more efficient to read through the textbook and notes by yourself instead of going to the lecture (Textbook is far more comprehensive and self-explanatory).-Overall, the grading scheme is very friendly (easy full mark on HWs and Quizzess) which the proportion of exams are not that high. You wont feel that stressed as workload is evenly distributed throughout the entire quarter. Homeworks and Quizzes are very easy, while Midterm is also very fair and straightfoward. The only challenge is the final, which needs great devotion and time spending on preparing for it. Generally speaking, Huang's Math115A is fair and I would recommend to take hers for future generations~","Spring 2022","A"

Our exams - two tests throughout the quarter and the final - were extremely hard to understand conceptually; thankfully, before each exam we were given a practice test, so the only way I was able to pass the exams was by repeating homework/practice exam problems over and over until I had memorized the steps, rather than actually understanding the content.

The second midterm did not have any errors but was also quite difficult. The final was far easier than the midterms. I got an A on the final but the midterms brought me down to a B+. This was after having taken IB Math SL which my teacher taught the same as AP Calc. Hempel does allow cheat sheets on all the tests for equations you need to know.In lecture, she would often start out concepts by showing the proofs, which took time away from learning how to do example problems.

He is also very passionate about teaching, and you can see that through his lecture. This class was at 8am and many of us were tired, he would tell a joke every class to try to keep us awake. He went step by step in explaining concepts and he would refer back to precalc if some students were lost. He would give practice midterms and the practice midterms would almost be the same thing as the real midterm. He allowed us to use scientific calculators and even allowed us to have a small cheat sheet. Even though the midterms were pretty easy, the final was truly a curve ball, it was so hard. In his OH he was very helpful and he tried to get to know  every student that attended.  I ended up walking out of the class with a B- and I was happy because I ended up retaking 3A.

I've had this mans for four quarters now at UCLA and he continues to be one of my poorer lecturers but one of the nicest professors I've had. The class is simply ""here is 50 problems - get 40 of them right and here's the A"". I found field theory/galois theory to be tedious and very unmotivating (though some of problems are pretty cool). He will give you ""recommended due dates"" but at about week 9 and 10, will say the rest of the problems are due. At that point, only about 25 were assigned. I think I spent about 3 all nighters trying to catch up on material and do some of these problems. I will also note I was part of the not as smart people in the class as you can tell by the grading distribution. I wanted to drop this class not because of DAG but because of the difficulty of the grading which leads me to our TA Tim. He's pretty nice. I have very mixed opinions on him. On one hand, he has a bit of a condescending attitude which made me feel the dumbest person and his grading made this course a lot more stressful than 110AH/BH. On the other hand, if you ask for help, he will be there and support you. I think because of the Covid/online environment, I personally got burnt out and found it harder to ask for help because it seemed like everyone already knew what was going on besides me.

The material is engaging and Professor Elman clearly cares deeply about it and wants his students to share his passion. He even holds a bonus lecture every week which takes the material covered in class and extends it to more advanced/interesting applications (generally these bonus lectures are not covered on the tests). This class in particular deals with Ring Theory and Module Theory. If you haven’t taken 110AH this class will be very difficult as a solid understanding of group theory is essential for understanding rings and modules. If you are deciding whether to take this class, here are some details about the class that may help you decide. First, Professor Elman generally does an in class midterm and a second, take-home midterm (broken into two parts for this class). The grading scheme he uses depends on your midterm scores but provided you do well on one of them, you will he set up for success in the class. Second, the tests for this class are longer than the class period. The professor gives extra time because he doesn’t want time pressure to be an issue, but this usually means the questions on your in class tests will be more difficult. Third, work on the take-home test as soon as you get it. I have made the mistake of leaving the test to the last minute and even though it is only 10 problems, it will take 10-20 hours to complete. Fourth, the pace of this class is intense. If you zone out for more than a few seconds in lecture, you will struggle to catch up to what the professor is writing, and a huge amount of material is covered over the span of a quarter. I personally filled up around two pages front and back per lecture. Fifth, the final for this class is seven hours. Sixth, the module theory section of this class is significantly harder than the ring theory section. Ultimately, this class is really hard, but a rewarding experience. If you enjoy algebra you should take a class with Professor Elman and if you liked your past group theory class I highly recommend this class.","Winter 2020","A"

Dallas was unorganized, frustrating, and impossible to get in contact with. During seminars she was nice and friendly, and made you feel like you knew what you were doing. But her instructions for assignments were never clear, and nothing got graded until week 9 (come to find out I had misinterpreted the instructions, although early in the quarter when I asked during class what she meant by them, she confirmed my interpretation was correct). Anyways, the person who (finally) graded the homeworks wasn't even Dallas, it was a math specialist from the Curtis Center (not anyone related to the class whatsoever). Dallas is impossible to reach via email, doesn't check the discussion board, and mentioned once at the beginning of the quarter that she had office hours but never brought it up again (and it wasn't in writing anywhere). I wasn't able to attend office hours due to class conflicts, and if you can't go to office hours you basically can't talk to the professor. She always goes over time for seminar, so if you have a commitment afterwards it's not like you can stay after class to talk to her. And her assignments for our quarter-long project were so disorganized, we didn't know what the end result was supposed to look like until week 10 (leading to us having to change a bunch of our work last minute).

The syllabus originally said we'd have a midterm and a final; we ended up having a take-home midterm and a final, with the midterm score being ignored if we do better on the final.

Prof. Kogar has done a great job introducing these two topics to guys who only know basic solid state physics. He had a well-written lecture note instead of textbooks and the lectures were illustrated in an ""experimentalist"" way (no long derivations and focus on the physical picture).Apparently, given the time (10 weeks only) and level (undergraduate) restrictions, he had to cheat on something, but he was always happy to chat about them in OH or through email (see if you can find them!). You can master the materials as long as you work out the excellent problem sets by yourself. It's really well written that you feel like you are guided step-by-step to tackle a complicated problem.My only concern (not for this course) is, the Physics 140 series here did not cover enough materials for students to get prepared for CM Physics in graduate school. For example, I think second quantization is quite useful.Overall, I really thank Prof. Kogar and his course for telling me the picture of these two really important phenomena in CM Physics without bothering from the long and hard mathematical derivations, and I strongly recommend every student who is interested in CM physics take this course.","Winter 2022","A+"

Always check the grading after it is done and make sure that it seems accurate as accidents do happen. Professor Kraus goes very strictly by the textbook, so I always found it helpful to read before attending class.

The first lecture seemed promising and Professor Bruinsma came off as a sweet Dutch man who would make this quarter enjoyable and manageable. If only that were the case.The weekly homework assignments usually consisted of a MasteringPhysics assignment (10ish modules) and a written portion due in class. The MasteringPhysics was manageable and honestly quite helpful, but the written portions of the homework assignments (anywhere from 6-9 multipart questions) were A.) illegible, B.) more conceptual based and confusing (my excellent TA, God bless his soul, had issues understanding what was being asked sometimes), and C.) ultimately not helpful in terms of the midterms or final exam.The lectures were 1 hour 50 minutes long and were boring beyond belief. You could just chalk that up to the material at hand, but from my experience, physics doesn't have to be boring. Corbin's physics lectures are informative, engaging, and as entertaining as physics can get (seriously, take Corbin if you can). Perhaps it would've helped if I could actually read what Bruinsma was writing on the board. I kid you not, at one point  Bruinsma had a student from lecture REWRITE his notes in real time and have them projected on the big screen. Where's the logic in that? He also made mistakes quite often that had to be corrected by students in lecture.Lecture attendance was ""mandatory"" in a pretty loose sense. Every so often, a sign-in sheet would make its rounds, but this happened so sporadically and seemingly with no rhyme or reason. Discussion section attendance was mandatory, but I'm glad it was because my TA (Patrick) did such a good job at explaining loose ends from lecture, as well as helping us figure out the homework assignments. Seriously, thank you Patrick.As for the exams, both midterms and the final had ""bonus questions"" that could be a blessing or a curse depending on what side of the curve you find yourself on. For example, the bonus question (worth 25 points) on the first midterm brought the average up to near perfect, with some people scoring 100/75. I personally didn't care too much about the bonus questions being included, but when you explicitly state that the second midterm WILL NOT have a bonus question, and it ends up having one, it's not the best look.. Similarly, Bruinsma stated that the final exam would not have a double-slit problem, but lo and behold question #6 I think was a double-slit problem. There also was not a single question on optics, despite putting quite a bit of emphasis on it in lecture and the homework assignments. I don't know if Bruinsma was deliberately misleading us, or if he just doesn't read his exams before making 200 copies and distributing them (typos galore as well), but come on, get it together.Overall, I can not recommend this class to anyone taking 1C. You'll likely ending up teaching yourself from the textbook and Mastering Physics. There is also the chance that by the grace of God, have a TA like Patrick who makes life so much easier, but that's not a guarantee. Take Corbin if you can.","Winter 2019","C"

The examples he goes through in class are alright, but he just copies whatever he worked out beforehand, even the mistakes… meaning to say I have never seen him thinking on his feet or doing an actual analysis of the problem in class. If I were a professor, I would do that only if I’m unfamiliar with my topic and require notes all the time. Asking him questions were a pain; he skirts the question often, and upon being pressed to give a rigorous physics explanation, he simply uses analogies, or resort to the all-encompassing generic answer that things are just the way they are (example, he tried to explain Brewster’s angle in the topic of light, but had to resort to “oh it’s just a behavior of light…”.Peroomian’s grading was weird. It was a 100% Final; as long as you attempted your midterm, your score for final was yours to keep.

I'm not mad she uses it bc you should have had it from 5A and 5B so no additional money there. she even assigns optional ""tutorials"" which are practice problems with a ton of hints which really helps guide my learning moreso than textbook reading because it's practice and application based rather than passively reading. try them out for circuits especially!.THE WOMAN HERSELF: Jackie is snarky and cute! and genuinely cares about student learning. if class time conflicts, she goes out of her way to accommodate you. if you have another final the same day, she'll even let you take a different final time.OVERALL: great course and she's very clear what she expects from you. yes it's challenging which warrants a lot of negative reviews from premeds and bio majors who want to keep their GPA up but as biochem I'm already used to getting shit grades so it doesn't hurt me lol. I noticed this trend with my favorite physics prof anton bondarenko too so people are just salty! I think it's when the professor is so clear and then ur like ""damn this class easy"" and then they ask something that applies the basic concepts u learn but more conceptually and ask u to solve something thru understanding rather than plug and chug and people flip. just try your best and use all your resources okay! good luck bb","Spring 2019","A+"

I can appreciate that Complex Analysis is beautiful, but I just don't get that excited because it's pure and unapplied math. Literally everything in this class is just exploring the implications of i^2=-1. The only reference to physics was in the first lecture, when Kraus said that his research on black holes and AdS/CFT correspondence uses complex numbers when it treats time as imaginary. I thought we'd explore applications of complex analysis, so I was a bit disappointed. However, I was doing 114 (acoustics) at the same time, and I got to apply some of the things (including the Euler-Lagrange equations) from 132 to the concept of potentials in 114, which was fun. The textbook is Brown and Churchill's Complex Variables and Applications. It's easy to read and Kraus follows it closely. The tests are moderately hard but I think the curve is generous.

I got too bored to watch the lectures or even read the textbook systematically by week 5, so I just attacked the homework problems and referred to the textbook when I got stuck.

There were often questions that tested knowledge or skills that weren't even mentioned in class, and that you basically wouldn't be able to do unless you went to office hours.During this quarter, the professor also introduced in-class worksheets. These were frustrating for several reasons. First, they often had questions we were not at the time equipped to answer. For example, when we just started talking about Feynman diagrams, we had a worksheet asking us to draw a bunch of them, and some could only be done with the strong force -- which isn't covered until several more weeks into the quarter. Second, a lot of class time was devoted to going over these worksheets, which is honestly more suited towards discussion section. (To be fair, ours was at 8 am so maybe nobody showed up and the professor still wanted us to get practice -- but then, the discussion section worksheets were uploaded so we still could have chosen to look at them in our own time.) Third, the professor expected us to hand the worksheets in to her by hand at the end of lecture, but almost always her lectures would go at least five minutes overtime, which was a problem for anyone with a class or other commitment immediately after the class. I emailed her with my concern, and she said she'd try to do better, but never did. So, I had a friend turn in my worksheet (which I completed myself) for me so that I could leave on time, and she emailed me accusing me of cheating (even though I've emailed her about my situation and she's the one who refuses to accommodate it). She was overall really unfriendly there, which made me hesitant to reach out to her about other class related issues. Lectures were recorded, but only the audio (which is a way to appreciate that the professor incorporated visuals a lot, wrote on the board, etc, although slides were also used and uploaded). The homework was graded pretty harshly, but that depends on the grader (I've gotten points docked for answers that were very similar to what students got full marks for in previous quarters). There is also considerable class time and homework devoted to Feynman calculus, which is considered a graduate level topic and should not appear on any exams.","Winter 2024","A"

If I had to give a tip to do well on the midterms I would say do the practice midterms he gives out and go to the review session. The questions on the midterms/final were not computationally intensive but rather conceptually difficult, so you really have to make sure you understand the ideas presented in this course. The final exam was exactly like the midterms just longer. The midterms/final are open book but the midterms are designed to take almost the whole time of the class so it doesn't really help for those.

Taking Bauer during fall quarter absolutely sucked. I heard from all my friends who took him in the past that he was a pretty chill dude so I was excited to take the class. However, I guess after doing spring and summer online and having kids receive a shit ton of As that made him become a bit jaded and make the class a bit more annoying to complete.  Initially, the class seems like your average physics class with discussions  (10%), labs (15%), and homework (10%), and quizzes (40%). However, he attempted to mix up the class a paper that counted as a midterm (2.5%) and a final paper that was worth (12.5%).  For the first paper, I'll give him a pass because it didn't really matter since it was worth so little and was supposed to be a litmus test for what he was looking for in the final paper. But the problem was that he didn't even give proper feedback to the first paper so we couldn't even learn from our mistakes coupled with the fact that we had a final and final paper in the class due just made the whole process so stressful.  Not even to mention he originally had the basis of an A increased that a solid A was a 95 as well.  I just feel overall he really seemed like he wanted to reduce the number of As in the class but I just felt like the addition of the papers as well as his stubbornness regarding grading as well just left a sour taste in my mouth. I'm sure in person he's a decent person to take but as for online I say just avoid him all together unless you absolutely have to.","Fall 2020","A"

He uses a combination of powerpoint slides and handwritten notes. I never took a physics class prior to taking the 5 series, but he teaches from the very basics and builds onto that. He tends to follow the textbook closely, so it is not necessary to read the textbook. In regards to studying for exams, it is crucial to understand the problems that he goes over during the review sessions. The problems on the exam tend to resemble those of the review sessions but with slight modifications. The midterms are time-constrained, which resulted in rather low averages, but the final exam was fair. The only tough part is being able to draw connections when solving the problem because he asks for the answer in terms of certain variables. He is generous in allowing one notecard per exam. Homework is assigned through Mastering Physics, which you will need to purchase. He allows many attempts with no penalties. There are clicker questions, but they are graded based on participation and not accuracy. Discussion is optional, but usually the TAs will go over certain homework problems that Bondarenko handpicks. Also, he tends to teach a little bit slower than the other physics professors, so you may find it difficult to do the labs when he has not taught that topic yet. Finally, his grading scale is like a rank system, and he claims that it is only more generous than a normal grading scale. Overall, Bondarenko is an excellent professor, and I do not regret taking him for both 5A and 5B. He is such a patient professor, and it is really obvious that he genuinely cares about his students.

There's a weekly problem set and weekly mastering physics questions, but they shouldn't take more than 2-3 hours to complete. In my opinion, the exams (2 midterms, 1 final) were pretty easy, considering that I only watched one lecture throughout the entire quarter.

Justin Lancaster is an utterly incompetent professor. I was forced to take Lancaster for Physics 5A and Physics 5B because the other professors’ classes had filled, and I can say without a doubt that Lancaster is the worst professor I’ve ever had or will ever have at UCLA.First, Lancaster chose to use pre-recorded lectures from Spring 2020 as our lectures for the Winter 2021 quarter. If you want to spend thousands of dollars of tuition on year-old lecture videos and have a professor give zero effort in return for all the work you put into a class, then Lancaster is your guy! In these pre-recorded lectures, Lancaster spends an hour reading word-for-word off the textbook company’s pre-prepared slides and rattling off equations and concepts without providing any explanation for where they came from. This made it very difficult to understand how to apply those concepts and equations, and it again demonstrates how Lancaster could not even put in the effort to make his own slides or prepare his own explanations.Second, Lancaster made it very difficult to have a live interaction with him or get our questions answered during office hours. The quarter began with professor Lancaster’s office hours being held on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 4 PM as stated in the syllabus, but they were suddenly changed in the middle of the quarter with no reason given to us to Tuesdays at 10 AM and Thursdays at 11 AM. Many students reached out to professor Lancaster to tell him that those new times conflicted with our other classes, but he decided to keep the new times because they worked better for him even though far fewer people were able to come to office hours after that. If you are fortunate enough to be able to attend office hours, Lancaster frequently makes mistakes when solving problems and has to be corrected by students.Finally, the exams are extremely stressful and unpredictable. Lancaster decided that giving less time for exams would be best for remote learning, so he subjected us to 35 minute midterms and a 2 hour final. Lancaster made no accommodations for students who have Internet issues, do not have a quiet home environment, or are international students in a different time zone. In fact, in one of his last office hours sessions, he said that he would be deliberately giving international students a more difficult final exam. On top of that, Lancaster provides hardly any study material that is representative of what exams are like. The old tests and discussion worksheets are nowhere near the difficulty of his current exams and they sometimes do not even have the same topics as his current exams. On our second midterm and final for 5B, he tested us on topics such as tension, static equilibrium, and projectile motion that are literally 5A material! It is also impossible to earn 100% in the homework category to cushion your grade, because Professor Lancaster set up Mastering Physics so that you lose points if you don’t get the answer correct on your first try.In conclusion, even if Lancaster improves when we return to in-person learning, his complete lack of effort or concern for students during a global pandemic speaks volumes about his true character as a person and his inadequacy as a professor.","Winter 2021","A"

Just a few words before I start: DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS if you want an easy A ge. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS if you are not that good at physics (no foundation, poor at physics, etc.). DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS if you are not good at math. Otherwise, you will SCREW you gpa. Just a kind reminder.-Grade Distribution: Five biweekly quizzes, each consists of a 30-point, 4-subpart questions. Every quiz is worth 12%, in total quizs worth 60% of your grade.  Final Exam is worth 30% of your grade, which consists of five 30-point-quiz-like questions. Homework on Pearson is worth 10% of the final grade. Professor Corbin will replace your lowest quiz by your second lowest.-About Exams: Corbin's exams are absolutely DISASTERS. Those horrible quizzes, in general, have a mean grade around 58% and median around 61% out of 100%. Corbin never give simple questions like multiple choice or short answers. The worst thing is, not a single question has a number in it, which means every question he gives you'll have to deduct expressions with unknown quantities. Do the derivation and integration based on unknown quantities, which its difficulty is normally not suitable for a class like 1A. Final exam is worse, the mean grade is around 48% out of 100% (72 out of 150), median around 50%. If you are not that good at physics, you might find you cannot solve a single subpart of  a question. Frankly speaking, Corbin's exams are so tough that your preparation through homework and lectures might be completely useless. For those who have to go with Corbin, I can only suggest you to go over his notes and lectures again and again, fully understand every single question on hws, go to office hours more often to figure out what you dont understand. Let me put in this way: Corbin's exams are designed for those top and genius science students or those with very very good physics foundation/very good at physics.  His exams remind me of the day I was practicing for Physics Bowl and International Physics Olympiad Comp, that's how it is, somehow as as difficult as those comptition-kind questions. For those who have options other than Corbin, do it anyway.-About Lectures: Professor Corbin may be one of the best lecturers I've ever met at UCLA. His class is well organized and super clear. Detailed explanations and demonstrations on the questions and contents are very straightfoward, so even if you have no physics basics, you can definitely follow his steps and learn some physics in class (Well, his exam is another story). Besides, his class is also very interesting and intriguing. You wont fell boring during his class, and I can assure you that you can absolutely learn something here. And Professor Corbin is a very nice and professional instructor.-About the Curve: As far as I know, Corbin's curve is QUITE NICE. For those who can score a couple of points higher than the median every time, you have a guaranteed A. Here's our educated guess based on our grades and information: Getting Around 70%-75% out of 100% in the final grade, you have a very high possiblity to get an A (my friend got 78/100 = A in the total final grade), Above 80% is a guaranteed A (I got 80.6/100 = A, and everyone I know above 80 is an A through out the entire academic year). Overall, around 30 to 40 percent of the entire class can get an A, so the A rate is not that low. Do not panic if your score seems to be low on an absolute scale. ALWAYS COMPARE WITH STATISTICS PROVIDED. As long as you score above the mean, you will be fine. If you score above the median, you did pretty well and dont need to worry at all. If you score one standard deviation above the mean, then you are awesome and in the A range.-In general, if you are not that confident with your physics/math, or if you want an easy A ge, or if you want to get a good grade and gpa, AVOID THIS CLASS AT ANY COST. If you are stuck with him and dont have any other options, I would say follow his lectures and notes, spend lots lots of time studying physics, get some practice on the internet, and go to his office hours to ask questions, and I hope that every of you can get the grade you want.

To those reading reviews from the same time period take both sides with a pinch of salt, as no side is entirely right or wrong. Both the student body and the professor could have been more effective and considerate with their responses. As such I will spend my review explaining both sides and hopefully providing insight into how one should consider the potential taking of a class with Professor West.1.) Professor - Overall her teaching style is perfectly fine, with plenty of supplementary examples and a strong emphasis on understanding how and why given equations work the way they do. All of this works towards furthering the classes understanding of the underlying principals of physics through the learning of real world examples and logical reasoning. Furthermore, she is a nice and approachable person so there are no direct barriers to asking for help; in the online setting she periodically stops to answer questions and attempts to clarify the less direct points of learning. All that being said from this standpoint she is also a new professor, and as such has plenty of areas to focus on improvement. While I personally may not agree with the approach she took with regard to providing accommodations for those negatively impacted by the rioting and protests over the events surrounding George Floyd, she did have solid reasoning for what she did. However, much of the breakdown and frustration over the response came due to the use of impartial language in its delivery, as well as the reckless declaration of standpoints on a student's role in a university and as a person. It was clear that personal beliefs impacted her decision making, something I believe should be kept separate from the classroom setting. In addition, the tests provided were exceptionally difficult without a sufficient curve to back up one's proportional learning among the class (i.e. a score of 56% was left as raw for grading purposes despite that being the median score - something generally warranting a 70-80% in other classes). Finally, her use of a 50/50 split between AB grades and CDF grades is highly unorthodox, and potentially offers little to no benefit for those taking her class. Personally, I believe the implementation of a standardized z-score curve about a B or B+, a more traditional approach, would be more equitable and effectively reward students for their hard work (as it more accurately and fairly demonstrates one's placement within the class).2.) Students - As mentioned before and is evident by the less than impartial reviews, a significant portion of the class was left dissatisfied with the professor's response to the disastrous circumstances of 2020 Spring Quarter, particularly with the style of the final exam. Much of the distaste surrounding the topic was due to the inequitable implementation of recommendations from the Academic Senate and Physics Department, both of which strongly recommended the use of a ""No-Harm"" final where it could not negatively impact your score. West's rejection of that recommendation, instead choosing to simply fluctuate the weighting of the final exam left many to object — especially given the fact that other 1A and 1B courses chose the No-Harm route. While the pursuit for accommodations on a similar scale was not unjustified, the emotional response, choosing to bash the professor was uncalled for. She clearly cared about the well-being of the class, its just her words were not always well-reflected by her actions. Claims of support while providing minimal ease or accommodations left plenty to lash out emotionally, resulting in her being called heartless, detached, unsympathetic etc.","Spring 2020","B"

Professor Pau is pretty good. She's entertaining, funny, and her lecture were pretty clear, from the ones I attended. That said, she uploads her slides and most examples on CCLE, so you don't have to attend lecture.  I attended probably a total of ten out of the thirty lectures and still did well in the class. Discussion wasn't too helpful for this quarter, so I did not attend any after the first either. Homework and Quizzes are on MasteringPhysics and Chegg comes in really handy for that. Textbook is not necessary at all, just like with the rest of the series. Her tests are extremely straight-forward and fair; her midterm was pretty easy to be honest and her final was not hard. She also allows cheat sheets. Do her practice tests and examples to study, as a bulk of the questions are adapted from those of such style. Top 15% gets As, while the mean lies at a B, so her grading is pretty lenient. She also offers extra-credit later on. For material, I think this class was the most challenging for the entire Physics 5 series. I took Physics 5A and 5C beforehand and I think this class had the most math-intensive material. The only thing you need to know from Physics 5A for this class is Newton's Second Law. Labs are more similar to 5A, such that you have to do a pre-lab and post-lab and submit on Gradescope, as opposed to 5C's in-lab worksheet; however, pre-lab is graded on completion rather than correctness, unlike 5A, so that's nice. Overall pretty good class, would recommend taking it over the summer with Pau. Workload is pretty light, I took this class with a CS class, studied the day before for the midterm and final, and still managed to ace the class.

In my quarter she structured it as 4 exams, bi-weekly, the lowest score of which was dropped, so it helped relieve pressure because you didn't have one giant accumulative exam.  I will say that the class overall is a lotttt of work. There are mastering physics homework and prelecture problems, discussion worksheets, and pre-lab and lab writeups on top of the tests. BUT if you try to do all the work sincerely, then it will really boost your scores on the tests because you'll have to understand the material. Also, pre-lab and discussion are completion based, and mastering physics gives you three tries on everything so its super easy to get 100s on those. I would say you should do a lot of conceptual prep, and use variables as much as possible while practicing, because often on tests she doesn't give you numbers, so practicing with variables means you won't be thrown off by this on exams.

This class truly sucked the living soul out of me, and I can't say I came out of it as a better student.  Also, his exams are absolutely horrendous.  After each exam, it felt like I was in the wrong class (and the wrong major).  The average for the first midterm was ~58, the second ~43 and the third exam (non-cumulative ""final"" exam) ~40.  He even sent us an email explaining how disappointed he was in our averages.  It's completely his fault.  He can't just mumble through the lectures without picking up a pen and expect people to follow along.  Don't take this class, trust me.","Spring 2021","A-"

The second half of the courses homework problems are on Chegg, which was basically the only reason I passed the class. Chegg has step-by-step solutions for all the problems and really helps with understanding the concepts, I would definitely recommend investing in Chegg for the 3 months (maybe split the bill with other friends in the class and all use it and then cancel after the class is over). Kusenko uses lots of interesting demonstrations in lecture but his accent and quick talking makes the rest of it hard to follow. The only reason I had a vague understanding of what he was teaching was because I took AP Physics in high school, definitely not the class to take for your first encounter with physics.

Although it was Professor Tung's first quarter teaching, he definitely deserves credit for the effort and dedication he put into teaching this class to the best of his ability.  My advice for passing this class is simple : LISTEN in lecture, take detailed NOTES, attend DISCUSSION, and review CONCEPTS.  I never had a problem with the way he utilized lecture time. If people actually bothered to pay attention and listen to what he was saying, then his lab demonstrations made sense and the concepts were easier to grasp. Some reviews argue that he spent too much time deriving formulas, but I have to disagree. He skipped over tedious calculus that was used to derive the formulas, and instead used the formulas to show the relationships between parameters (i.e. proportional, inversely proportional). This was actually very useful in multiple choice problems in his exams. I did put in effort to take notes during class, but even if I hadn't, on CCLE he posts NATHAN'S NOTES which are his own written notes that covers everything he says during lecture. Moreover, I found discussion to be extremely helpful. I think many people struggled with this class because we did not see many problems during lecture and mainly focused on concepts. However, discussion is where we actually got to see problems relating to the concepts. With this said, out of the 38 enrolled spots in discussion, only about 10 people actually bothered to show up weekly. I think this lack of attendance definitely contributed to negative reviews for this class. Anyways, my discussion TA reviewed important problems that were reflected on midterm multiple choice problems and helped me grasp concepts even better. In regards to the midterms for this class, I was also blindsided by the first midterm. Nevertheless, just writing down everything you know scores you points. Even if it was a hard test, if you truly understood concepts, then you should be able to score 1 or 2 points above average. As for the second midterm and final, they were completely fair. Professor Tung held review sessions that covered everything he expected. All in all, this class wasn't terrible and I feel like anyone can pass this class if they bother to listen in class and spend time understanding concepts.

She would always go out of her way to answer any questions we have and even made time on weekends to schedule zoom office hours for students that struggled to understand how to use heuristics. If she taught any other course, I would probably take her other courses. This course was based on research for a 15 to 20-page paper on a topic of our choosing. I really enjoyed this course and would recommend anyone to take this course.","Spring 2022","A"

The most crucial element to his class is attending discussion having read the material and being prepared to discuss and dissect it. The class relied on three essays and weekly readings that made up the majority of your grade. The workload is reasonable with a heavy reliance on required (student purchased) texts on dense philosophy and theory. Attend lecture, attend discussion, engage, and write your essays well.

Professor Lofchie is extremely knowledgeable and has immense experience over countless disciplines. He is very friendly, welcoming, and understanding. With that being said, he is an older gentleman with a more old-school teaching style/expectations. If you attend lecture, keep your camera on, and ask questions, I assure you you will do just fine. Student participation in this course for some odd reason was extremely low with two cameras on and the same two people participating which was slightly disheartening for myself and the professor. One important thing to note is his hesitation to record lectures in an effort to maintain a higher student turnout during his live lectures was surely influenced by this low student participation throughout the quarter. This personally did not affect me because I attend lecture regardless, but I understand this is a deal breaker for some students. Professor Lofchie took into consideration the accommodations some students required, and went ahead and began recording lectures for these reasons. This quarter's workload consisted of multiple readings (of which he provided free of charge), and was graded on only two reasonably sized essays that drew from the knowledge and experiences from both lecture and the readings. Professor Lofchie has a great heart and much to share. He really does his best to ensure his students learn something valuable. I would highly recommend any poli sci or economics student take at least one of his courses and develop a great relationship with this man who has much to share and give.

There was no final, rather we had to submit a six-page essay on an important foreign policy issue, in Fall 2021 the essay examined where the US went wrong in Afghanistan.

If you did that though, you would still need to pay a small amount to have access to the Inquizitives. The textbook was absolutely necessary to have as the whole class was based on it. The professor did lectures but they often were really just a repetition of the textbook, so I did not think they were necessary or very helpful to be present for. However, I think there were some helpful bits but if you stick to reading the textbook and doing notes, you should be good. There were a total of 14 chapters we needed to get through for this class and in the end it felt kind of rushed, making me a bit overwhelmed at times. After each chapter we needed to complete an Inquizitive, which I found really helpful in retaining the information and the main points we needed to be aware of. The midterms and final were all open-note and were done on our own within a certain time window, making them easy to access and fairly easy to find information if you forgot something. We had three options for completing a Current Event Analysis which required us to apply information from certain topics in the textbook to real world situations. You could do all three or just one and the highest score was applied. I thought this was a fun and easy way to look further into World Politics so I personally really enjoyed it. Overall, the class wasn't too difficult so long as you stayed on top of the textbook work and utilized the notes you took for the exams.

I have always enjoyed Political Theory although it isn't my emphasis but there are lessons here that can be applied to the contemporary and personal. The course is Plato-intensive, she does cover whether he is the first feminist, Ancient Greek thought, looks at Ancient Rome, Christian philosophy, and she concludes with Machiavelli.I did not get an A solely because I did badly on two pop quizzes. I only did get a 5 once on them, you should really be ahead in the readings as much as possible (I think this is where I messed up).I recorded and listened to the lectures on my commute. I strongly advise you to look into how to listen to audiobooks when you're too busy too read (see youtube). Be active in your discussion and make an effort to not miss a day. The class is very fairly graded and distributed throughout the term. Her midterm and finals are passage-derived. She will pick a passage from one of the readings up to the midterm and expects you to connect it to the text, author, overall message, and connection to the other texts. You have about 5 or 15 minutes ( I forget which) per passage. No term papers. No books to buy, she posts everything but you can also get different versions online (some free). Her quizzes are very straight-forward: she'll ask you bullet point questions which you can answer as such or in essay format.  Her final is cumulative which is the most challenging part. It does connect through though and should be able to figure it out. Her class and instruction inspired me to read other political theory and as an independent observer looking-in I saw some similarities between Plato's Kallipolis and other authoritative figures of the 20th century. To be culturally sensitive, I would rather not mention the authors I found parallels with but I think they are there. I think Plato is a feminist fascist.I loved this class so much.

I had a TA that couldn't really speak English too well and it was still not that difficult.What you need to do to succeed is basically cram all the material a couple nights before the mid-term and the final, and then consult your TA about your final paper to make sure its good.I'd recommend using Schwartz ""hunks"" (essentially really well written, concise summaries of each of his lectures, which can sometimes be uninteresting and slow paced), in addition to, or substituting lecture attendance. Also use the test bank for the mid term and final. The tests aren't hard, but he recycles the same questions from year to year, some of which are oddly specific scenarios that I definitely wouldn't have gotten correct if I hand't used the test bank.In summary, this class is ""easy"", but not in the sense that you can just sit back and expect everything to be taught to you.

Each exam had 5 multiple choice questions, 3 definition/term questions, 3-4 short answer questions, and one essay question.

We had one main paper & no final. There was a lot of freedom with our final paper so I used one of my intervention topics and just expanded on it. The course topics were all very abstract, so Trojan was the perfect professor for it. He is very much the teacher to answer your question with a question, or respond to ""Can I go to the bathroom?"" with ""Can you?""

This showed in the style of the course: round-table discussion, only about 20 students enrolled, and the only requirements of any kind being three (relatively short) papers and two sets of exercises. The material is composed of interesting topics in social and public choice theory, and requires heavy reading of complicated, high-level papers and literature by some of the field's most important names. The assigned essays are very flexible in their topics - Schwartz offers around 20 different prompts per assignment, and makes it clear that he'd also accept anything else that's related to that week's overarching topic. While the material itself is fairly difficult, he's fairly lenient on grading as long as you argue concisely and competently in your papers.

For every assignment he gave little to no guidance and when we asked he would say something like ""don't worry, it's easy."" But when we got our grades back, everyone did much worse than expected because he suddenly had all these expectations he never mentioned.

There are no PowerPoint slides, very few pictures/maps/videos as additional lecture materials. Prof. Orren is indeed lecturing in class; she simply speaks and answers questions, it's up to us to take the notes and remember the information. Slides or more materials during lectures would make this class so much more engaging and enjoyable, instead of just typing or writing things out the whole time. You MUST take copious notes during lectures and if you're unable to attend, since she doesn't record the audio or video on BruinCast, you will need to get them from someone else. The non-use of presentations or slides makes it difficult to keep track of the material being mentioned. Sometimes she will start on one topic and pivot to another point she mentioned earlier so be prepared to move around your notes. Sometimes this can become a little confusing, but she was good with tracking back and clarifying if needed.Lectures are not too focused on reading. Prof. Orren will follow the reading dates posted in the syllabus (Reconstruction readings paired with lectures on Reconstruction), but she doesn't mention the books very often. This is why the readings (at least for this term) are most important for section since we discussed them exclusively in detail. Professor Orren is indeed knowledgeable on this topic and provides lots of information; it is simply not organized very well which means it comes down to you to parse what is important and what is not. My notes during lecture helped me tremendously on the midterm and final exams. Her essay prompts are pretty vague; some find them to be too much so. I found them to be open-ended enough to allow me to go where I wanted to go and argue what I knew, while also staying within the prompt. I would create a study group early on to discuss readings (maybe even split up the chapters since the readings are quite extensive) and prepare for the essay exams; this vastly helped me in the course.I believe the course itself is extremely subjective and open-ended -- the course description itself is vague. An ""overview"" of ""American political development"" could mean a plethora of things depending on who you ask and is up to interpretation by the professor. Take the facts of history, combine it with the readings and lecture material, and you're good. With readings, as stated in other reviews, do not get caught up in minutia or specific details; simply understand the main ideas with some evidence from the text to back it up. As long as you can do that and combine it with lecture material, you'll do well.","Fall 2022","B"

I don't understand how she is still teaching at UCLA.

She responded that we were ""barraging"" her with emails (how rude of us to let her know she made a mistake right?) and said that the Midterm has been deleted but that the test was still on. That meant half the class that had realized her mistake prior had access to the test before the midterm and could spend over 24 hours figuring out the answers.

Okay, that is fine, but I do not understand why he made us to purchase all these pricey materials, when very little of the materials were incorporated on the exams. In addition, I have no idea how most of us got such a low final grade. For me, my midterm score was 96%, and I scored full score for all quizzes. I also completed the extra credit quiz. Yet, after both the final exam where I scored a 90% and the final paper where I scored 88%, I end up receiving a B+ for the overall class grade. This is absurd, because while other professors have made the class fairly accommodating, he made the class harder by curving under a b.s. scale. If you guys still want to take this class, fine.

Lectures were very dry with very little direction and it was evident by low attendance and engagement. Although there were very few assignments in the course, the professor only graded the forum posts (based on completion) and the research proposals (which were 1-2 pages). The two biggest assignments, the midterm and final paper, were instead graded by a grader, and many of my peers expressed concerns over the grader's harsh grading during the midterm, to the point where Bang had to hold extra office hours for people to discuss a potential regrade for the midterms. Now after all this, you would expect for the grader to be a little more lenient on the final paper, but as many of my peers have expressed once again, there were again many controversies with the grades. This wouldn't be an issue if there was a clear breakdown of the grades and a rubric to show where we may have lost points, but that was never given to us.

Grades are not posted yet, but I am very confident in my ability to get an A. If you did well in your first intro to programming class in C++, which is a prerequisite, you will do well in this class. That does not mean go back and study C++. I am trying to say that if you have a good foundation, MATLAB should seem like a blessing. It is very easy to use and understand for beginners. Professor Frane's workload is very minimal, in fact I wished at times that there were more practice problems for us to hone our skills; however, with all of the resources and the help from the instructor and assistants it was not hard to get an A on each assignment so far. My best advice would be to attend the labs ready to talk about the material. That means you MUST watch the lecture videos before coming to lab (even if your lecture is only a few hours before lab like mine is)! This is important because if not then you are confused when the TA asks to help solve the challenge problem. If you watch all of the lecture videos before the lab, participate as much as possible in lab, and take your time on the homework to make it clear and document properly you will do well in this class. Follow all of Professor Frane's tips to ensure your code is clear, concise, and as efficient as possible because this is key. Regardless of whether we were online I believe the class will operate similar. Grading is very fair, I made a few mistakes such as not putting my name in the file name and did not get marked down - even though I clearly did not follow the simplest instructions. You will however get marked down for not getting the correct answer (obviously). You may get a comment regarding how to make something more efficient, but because there are many ways to go about a problem you do not get marked down unless it is wildly inefficient or poor practice (such as hard-coding things or not using a loop when you clearly should have). I came up with some pretty creative solutions that were nothing alike the TAs or Professor Frane's solutions, so don't feel scared to jump in there and try something (you may even come up with a more creative/efficient solution). Another tip I feel is important is to really give yourself a chance to attempt the problem before running to external sources for answers. This will help build that logical foundation that is important for programming. Attendance was only mandatory for labs and we only need to attend 5 of them in total. There were no exams or finals, but 10 homework assignments due every week. These homework assignments act sort of like projects, so it is important to do well on ALL of them.

I really enjoyed the class (even though I may have fallen asleep several times, but I do this in EVERY class unfortunately...) if you are interested in developmental psychology, this is the best class to take as it gives you an introduction to it and is not overwhelming. It was a fairly easy class, just make sure you pay attention to lectures as most of the exam questions are from here. There are several odd-ball questions from the reading book, and honestly, I did not read but skimmed it and still managed to get an A-. This may be because he does drop your lowest score if I remember correctly, and there is a generous curve. My FAVORITE PART OF CLASS was when he showed us video clips of the experiments he was talking about. He also likes to show graphs. If you are a visual person, this class is great since he incorporates visuals. Great class! I would definitely recommend. He is also a very funny and SARCASTIC guy. His jokes are funny and he is even great if you have him for his honors discussion for this class.

He encourages collaboration between students, so make sure you check your answer with somebody else before you submit because making careless mistakes is so common especially in problem sets. That being said, don't worry about your grade too much because you will get a lot of chances for bonus points and probably a large curve for the final.

I think she broke down the material into processable pieces, especially for introductory psychology students. This was my first time taking a psych class (ever), and it honestly made me more interested in the field.She uses clickers for participation, meaning you have to attend lecture. Most of her clicker questions are based solely on participation, but there are a couple that are based on correctness. She does drop the 3 (or 4, I can't remember) lowest clicker scores, which is nice!I found her midterm really easy. I made flashcards on all the key terms and studied them a couple days in advance, and I think I only missed one question. She had 30 multiple choice questions and two short response questions, but I found them quite fair. There is a significant emphasis on the studies/articles she assigns, so I would read those over before the tests. I also attended the review session, and that was a really nice refresher on all the general information that was going to be on the test.Clark also uses Piazza to communicate with her students (other than email). I had never used Piazza before, so I found it a little tedious to use, but she did answer any questions that came up on that interface. I didn't use Piazza at all and attended TA office hours instead, which were super helpful. I would usually just go when a lab/article analysis was due, and the TAs would help check my answers and make sure that I hit all the gradable points.","Winter 2020","A+"

The reading responses were also a joke because it the beginning lots of people didnt do well and by week 8, they said ""oh we're adjusting the grading scale so more people can get full marks."" I think she would have been a great upper div professor because she wants her students to critically think on tests and do loads of extra work, but for psych 10 -- an INTRODUCTION to psychology-- it was too much.

I did the SONA extra credit which is 3 points added on the final. For the mid-term he asked one extra credit question which was worth 5 points max; it asked for the probability of getting a “Royal Flush” in a deck of cards. I didn’t get the right answer on this extra credit question but I worked out the question and explained my reasoning. However, the TA gave me a 0/5 on the extra credit which I found a bit harsh, as the professor was lenient on the extra credit on the final. It is not an all or nothing problem, but the TA graded it that way. On the Final I got 7/10 on the extra credit, which was 2 5-point questions.

What i do is I highlight the pages and go back and read my highlights again.  When the TA sends out the study guide, it is helpful to write down the page number to where you can find the material and go back to read.  Another important thing is either go to lectures and take good notes or listen to the podcast and take good notes.  I ended up with an A in this class and I didn't even go to lectures that much, but i made sure that I listened to the podcast and read the book thoroughly.  His tests are sort of poorly worded in the sense that there are like double negatives in the questions and like it's just the way he writes the questions makes it seem ambiguous or hard to understand since people don't usually talk that way.  but I think that if you read and take good notes you will do good in the class.

It was definitely one of my favorite classes at UCLA and it led me to choose to go into the field of early childhood trauma research. Dr. Goff is THE MOST down to earth and honest professor I've ever had. She knows what it's like to be a student and she always keeps things in perspective. She's also hilarious (she doesn't sugarcoat anything, she has some blunt humor lol), and great at explaining complex concepts with relatable examples. She also doesn't tolerate disrespectful or offensive comments from students, which I really appreciated in the context of this course material.This course gave me a GREAT foundation for understanding neurodevelopment and translational research, and prepared me really well for Psych115 and Psych119A (both of which are very rigorous, difficult neuro classes). She knows how to get you to really understand and remember the way the brain and the body work without relying to heavily on rote memorization. The tests had short-answer questions, some of which required you to draw things like the brain and the fight or flight response. I really preferred this over multiple choice courses I've taken with Dr. Goff. If you're interested in the differential effects of abuse and neglect, in the development of disorders like conduct disorder or antisocial personality disorder (+ treatments like attachment therapy), or in facial expression processing, I really recommend taking this. Some topics discussed include orphanages abroad, cults, substance use, abuse, and neglect.That being said, this course can be very heavy. Do not take this if you have triggers related to abuse, neglect, etc. Dr. Goff will be understanding if you do, but it will be hard for you.

The exam format was awful because you're forced to work with other students on the 2nd part of the exam..ugh! The first 2 midterms were OK, mostly straight-forward and directly tested you on the content.

He also let us use one notecard as a cheat sheet for the final. The assignments were easy, it was just a one-page ""reaction paper"" of what we learned that week; it was very open-ended and graded pretty much on completion.

I felt like this class was very fair, and the professor is very clear on what is expected of you. Sure, there are times during lecture where you may be bored but the subject is pretty technical so that may be expected.Shams has changed the grading scheme so now there is only one exam (the final) that is worth 30%, 3 paper critiques (each worth 20%), and some minilabs (worth 10% total).  There is also a ton of extra credit offered, you can get AT LEAST 3% for participating in SONA and submitting an exam question, which is an entire letter grade! If you do well on pop quizzes and go above and beyond on the papers, you can get even more extra credit. But the 3% alone is unheard of, especially for a column A class. I'd make sure to do all the EC cuz it's very easy, and that cushion or boost may be very helpful by the time you take the final. Also, one thing that's great about this class is you don't have to show up if you don't want to- not even to discussion (never had a class like that before). I personally never showed up to lecture or discussion and got an A, but I still worked hard for it. I heard the discussion are really helpful though cuz you can get personal help from the TA since not many students show up, so you may be encouraged to go if you feel like the topics covered are difficult.So as stated previously, the bulk of your grade comes from 3 papers. For each paper, you read a research paper and answer some questions on it. They were pretty easy if you have taken psych 100b before, basically you just find the IVs and DVs, confounds, etc. stuff that should probably come 2nd nature to you if you've taken psych 100b somewhat recently. I was lucky enough to have taken it the quarter before taking this class so I found the papers to be pretty easy. I also liked that there were sentence limits to each question, since it gives you a sense of how much you need to write to answer the question, as I personally have a bad habit of writing too much. Though if you haven't taken 100b before, you may be wary about taking this class just because things like finding confounds and levels to the IVs aren't things that are intuitive, and the class has been changed to where the papers are worth more than half of you grade (I heard there used to be 2 exams). Also the TAs are limited in how much they are allowed to help you on the papers, so be mindful about that.I also felt like the final was fair- I was very worried about it beforehand just cuz it was the only exam we have ever taken for this class, so no one knew what to expect. She asks a lot of broad, somewhat superficial question so don't get so bogged down on the details to where you miss the main point of the concepts you learn. I felt like the book was not necessary, it tends to go too in-depth, giving you more info than you need to do well on the final. However, it may help you to read on some concepts you may be confused about. Just make sure you prioritize on knowing all the slides first. I just watched the lectures and typed everything she said that wasn't written on the slides. It's important you take good notes because the slides tend to lack material.Overall, I thought Shams was a great professor and it seemed to me like she designed a very fair class. Bottom line is, don't let all the negative reviews keep you from taking her class. I'd recommend this course to anyone that needs to fulfill the column A requirement","Fall 2019","A"

By far the coolest class I've taken at UCLA providing topics on the intersection of science and art in ways that I've never seen presented for. It was worth it taking this class just because of how unique the content is and I would recommend it. I enjoyed the small class size I wish I didn't have to take it over zoom but it was cool to find others that enjoyed these topics. The workload is pretty light because it is only 3 exams. You're not graded for participation (but you have to go because the professor doesn't post slides) and there's no discussion so it's not too hard to take along with other classes. You just need to be attentive and study your notes from lecture for the exams and you will be fine, although sometimes the exam questions are nuanced and specific or from the readings. Word of caution, the exams are only 18 questions each, and since nothing else is graded, you can only miss 5 questions in total to get an A-. The majority of the class did well despite this, and there would be a few students that would get perfect scores on her exams. Go to her office hour review sessions because she will give hints. Also, it should be noted that the professor is very blunt and it takes some getting used to and it's not coming from a bad place. She gives you the answers right after the exam and you go through it together which is so weird lol no other class I've taken has done this. She is old-fashioned in the sense that lectures aren't recorded or posted so you have to write everything down (this is kind of annoying for when you're looking at art or brain structures).  Despite the small annoyances, this is the one class whose topics will stay in my head and conversations forever.

Go figure.  Just choose the one with the most favorable reviews).If you can't avoid Minor, than my advice would be to get a seat up front, take good notes, record his lectures, and most importantly, GO TO THE TA'S!!!

One of the tests was assigned to Sunday-Monday, the Monday of which was a Holliday so we were forced to take the test on a weekend or a day off.

She genuinely cares about student learning, and would often be found answering student's questions on the BruinLearn discussion board into the early hours of the morning. However, there are a couple of things I wish I knew at the beginning of this class:1. You don't need the textbook. I didn't read it beyond the first week of class. I found her lecture slides & lectures to be perfectly comprehensive.2. Take very, very detailed notes. Dr. Wassum talks superrrr fast. She knows her stuff. With that being said, I'd often leave in-person lectures feeling pretty confused at times, but I'd go home & re-watch the lecture video about a day later & take notes to fill in any gaps I may have had. This often took a very long time, since I would pretty much pause the video every few minutes to write anything important down, but this process was soooo essential to my ability to understand & retain the information. On my first exam, I didn't perform very well, but was able to get 100% on my last 2 exams simply because I started to re-watch lecture videos & take more detailed notes.3. Make a study guide for exams. For my first exam, I kinda just winged it. I studied a little bit, but I relied a little too hard on just knowing the exam was open book. For the second and third exams, I made study guides that focused on understanding the experiments/concepts she presented during lecture. The exams focus heavily on your understanding of the concepts in an experimental/real-world context, so explaining each experiment (what it was testing, what happened, what the results were, what it told us about learning, etc.) helped me soooo much on the tests. My study guides literally consisted of just pages and pages of each experiment explained, and I referred to this often during exams.Overall, Dr. Wassum is a great professor who cares about her students and wants us to succeed.

A lot were obviously from past quarters and had information that was no longer relevant, which felt like lazy teaching to me.Your grade is comprised of a term paper and a free response final, each worth 50% of your total. The term paper was not that bad, but her rubric is very vague; even if you clarify what you should include in your paper with her, expect tough grading and points taken off arbitrarily without an explanation and a refusal to regrade. For the final, you have a week, but it is very time consuming and not straight-forward. Again, expect tougher-than-necessary grading.However, what I liked least about this class is how the professor would be very hard to get in contact with and blatantly ignore emails.

This class as a whole is also just about a useful topic in general too, and what you learn here should help jumpstart your knowledge toward data analyst and data science positions, so overall I think it's a good class to take. Note, however, that because there are pre-requisite Stats courses before this one, there's much less guidance compared to, say, Stats 20 (at least this was my experience). As someone who wasn't a very experienced programmer compared to some of my peers, I think I struggled a bit more than I'd like to admit during my time in this class.--The grading scheme was as follows:15% Lecture Viewing Quizzes20% Datacamp Homework36% Homework25% Final4% Campuswire Participation--Viewing quizzes, Datacamp, and Campuswire were basically free points, please do NOT forget about and waste them! Lecture-viewing quizzes weren't class content related, they were random letters, so if you're a data science expert you can't just skirt the quizzes. Datacamp was based on completion and was easy because there are tutorials on there, and Campuswire you just needed to get 150 points, plus an opportunity for extra credit if you went further (I think to 200?). Also, the premium subscription to Datacamp that you get for this class is valid for 6 months, so you can basically keep using it the quarter after you take this class which is excellent.--I mentioned before that you have to be more proactive and independent in this class compared to your other Stats lower divs and I think the homework reflects this. The first assignment was pretty straightforward and then it got more challenging from there. Not everything was straightforward and you sometimes had to think beyond the lecture examples, which admittedly are pretty clear but don't always directly relate to the homework. That said, reading the documentation online for the different libraries/data science technologies you're using is pretty helpful as is talking things out with peers. I didn't go to office hours too often but both Professor Chen and my TA Lucy seemed quite approachable and helpful so I'm sure that's a good way to go. Also, there were a lot of issues happening on campus the quarter this class happened that caused people mental distress, so Professor Chen was kind enough to give an extension on homework to everyone at that time.--The final was absurdly challenging and after talking with peers afterward, I don't think I was alone in not having completed the whole exam. The topics that appeared were also not what I expected; for example, there was a much bigger focus than I expected there to be on object-oriented programming. Personally, I think the final was the worst part of this class. That said, Professor Chen was pretty understanding and adjusted the grading upward on the final.--Overall I'd take this class again with Professor Chen, and would recommend you to take it as well.","Winter 2022","B+"

For our last midterm, there were something like 5 typos that were crucial to getting the correct answer.A big plus is the attendance system she uses. Instead of using clickers, she uses a program called tophat that costs $20 for the quarter.

I spent more time studying for the lab exams than the actual tests and did worse on them. Her midterms were very fair, not tricky at all. She lets you have a cheat sheet. But back to the lab exams, you have to be well prepared for them and get comfortable with coding because during the actual exam you'll only have 50 minutes and if you encounter a coding error, it'll take some time to troubleshoot.

However I didn't find any of these videos useful and her handwriting can be hard to read since she uses a pretty large pen size for her notes. Her actual lecture didn't seem that helpful to me. Her lecture is mostly her reading her notes and showing us coding in R, but it felt disorganized and all over the place. She also put us in breakout rooms to work on problem sets which she discusses the answers to after.I learned purely from the notes that she uploads to her CCLE site. The notes are okay, but they can look better. The notes have randomly chosen font sizes and there are some typos but if you understand the content, you can spot these. She uploads a bunch of files to CCLE but I recommend you use the notes and the ""CFUs"" to learn. The CFUs (Check for Understanding) are problem sets that deal with the topics we learn in lecture. She uploads the answers to them as well and these are great preparation for her midterms.We had 3 homework assignments but unfortunately we have to work on these assignments in a group. I wouldn't say these homework assignments are hard and long but it can be difficult working in a group when we're all in different time zones and when some people don't pull their weight.For the midterm and final, we were given a little bit more than 2 days to work on them. They're open notes, open book, open internet which was nice. They're about 4-5 questions with some questions having multiple parts, but the exams aren't too long and can be completed in 4-6 hours if you know what you're doing. They were pretty straightforward and mostly similar to the CFUs and homework. She also posts some previous midterm exams which definitely helped me study.The grading scheme is: Homework (20%), Midterm (40%), Final (40%)Homework assignments are graded very leniently and I think exam grading is fair. This class isn't difficult. Esfandiari isn't the best professor but she's nice and caring. She's disorganized at times but she cares about our learning.

However, she was the only professor Spring 2018, and I had to endure it with her. To give you some context, there were over 100 kids enrolled week 1, and during the final there were only 53 kids. OVER 50 KIDS DROPPED THIS COURSE. If this doesn't scare you, please keep reading.  During the first lecture on week 1, we were given a pop quiz that counted for a grade. On her syllabus, she makes ""participation"" worth 8% , and the final worth 35%. If you chose, you can opt out of the in-class participation exercises and make your final 43%. I'm telling you now, this is a TRAP. And it was the first of many I experienced over 10 weeks. Do not drop the participation to make your final worth more, because the final is so anxiety-inducing. To give you an idea of how awful the homework assignments were, she would make you copy-and-paste code from R into a CCLE portal (instead of a rendered HTML or PDF like a normal professor). But if your code had ANY errors at all, she gives you a 0. In terms of the exams, Sanchez puts WAY TOO MANY QUESTIONS for anyone to finish in 50 minutes. Her testing policies are neurotic, and yes, she will read every word on your cheat sheet to make sure it follows ALL of her arbitrary rules.  The midterm exams (each worth 23.5% of your grade) are a mix of MC, written response, and analyzing code. She will ask you to read through a page of code and point out ALL of the errors in the code AND fix them. (How was anyone supposed to do this??) Also, proofs are not off limits, and she won't hesitate to ask you for a proof on the exam! (Eyeroll) When it comes to exams, she also gives you the most inconvenient matricies to multiply. We had to multiply a (4x4) and a (4x1) BY HAND. To make it worse, each value had three decimal places. Perhaps the most annoying aspect of the exam is that she is very stingy with partial credit. Each exam question is only ONE POINT. So each exam is /15 points. (If you get two MC question wrong, you're already at a B, and it's worth 23.5%). To put things into further perspective, a 95% is a solid A. 94 or below is an A- . I bet you're wondering how the final exam could possibly be worse. Well, to answer that question: IT WAS ENTIRELY CODING. 100% of the final exam was done in R in a computer lab where we had to code algorithms to data sets she gave us. If you are not a strong programmer- this class is not for you. The final was open note (the only redeeming quality of this class), but the exam averages were awful throughout the quarter. The exam averages were: Exam 1) 57%, Exam 2) 61% , Final) 61% . Personally, I did above avg on one exam, slightly below avg on the other, and scored pretty well on the final, but somehow ended with a B- and do not think I deserved it at all. The smartest friends I had in that class also ended with a B- and I do not know anyone who earned a higher grade. 25/53 kids failed the final exam, so there is a high chance that ~50% of this class received a C+ or lower (just a rough estimate given my personal exam scores). If you are still somehow not convinced she is the WORST professor on this campus, keep reading buddy! On top of these awful exams and homeworks, she also is EXTREMELY patronizing and rude during lecture. She walks around the room while she lectures and actually kicked backpacks to walk through the aisles. I'm not exaggerating when I say almost every set of slides / worksheets she gave us had errors in them. Her lecturing style is very unorganized also. She scribbles all over the board illegibly, and does not post her handwritten notes online. There were SEVERAL instances where we would get emails from her saying ""found an error in the notes, please correct it"" and sometimes she wouldn't even tell us what the error was.  She also frequently keeps you over the 50 minute lecture time. The only reason I got through this class was because the TA was decent. For someone who has been teaching for 20 years at UCLA, I find this all absolutely unacceptable. There is no amount of psychological counseling that can help one cope with the bullshit she puts you through for ten weeks. Absolutely avoid this class at all costs. If you are thinking about taking any other class with her, keep this in mind. She truly does not give a FUCK about any of her students- even the ones who show up nearly in tears to office hours. So glad I'm done with this class.  See you in hell, Juana.","Spring 2018","B-"

Frankly I dont think she should be teaching at all, and it appears like the TAs do all the grading for her anyway. After taking this class, I still feel like I have learned nothing about stats. I dont know my final grade yet but im expecting anything from a B to an A-. I would have rather taken the class in person with a competent professor but they were not available to me. I wish I had waited to take Stats 100A instead. DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR. You are not going to be the top 1% of the class who gets an A. If you think you are, then you probably value your education, which in that case DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR since you will learn nothing.

He clearly cares about his students A LOT but is an ineffective lecturer. Each slide show presentation he uses during class is at least 80 slides long and are a complete mess. Reviewing them is often of no use due to their sheer length and lack of information (it’s actually amazing that he is able to make a slideshow presentation this long that is void of any informative content). During class, he brushes over information, doesn’t explain concepts at all and most of the time, people are sitting there lost, wondering “WTF is this guy talking about?” I have never once left and if his lectures and been able to tell you what he was taking about, never mind actually understanding what he was talking about. He NEEDS to begin structuring his thoughts and learn to maintain a clear train of thought for the sake of his students.Homework assignments all require the use of R and aren’t too bad, they can just be long. The only work that requires calculations to be carried out by hand are the midterm and final, which means you don’t get any formal practice carrying out equations by hand before the midterm and final, which is frustrating. The layout of the midterm and final is also messy with screenshots taken from R which can hinder your performance in the exam. The calculations required if you during the midterm are LONG and tedious. Completing an ANOVA table takes a lot of time and drawing factor diagrams for a repeated measures experiment is an art in itself. These tests are not easy to complete in the allotted time.Note: I completed this course during the coronavirus pandemic and the George Floyd riots so the final was able to be completed over 3 days so I’m not sure if it is representative of what his normal exams are like. The midterm was completed over an hour and 20 minutes as normal and it was hard to finish in time.There is a group project which I actually enjoyed a lot. I had a great group which was very motivating and we really worked well together. I feel sorry for those who weren’t so lucky in this regard.Quizzes contain content from lower division STAT courses so they’re OK if you still remember the content from those classes.I found the way to succeed in this course is to expect that you’re not going to get much out of the actual lectures. For me, the best method was to read the relevant textbook chapters, take note of the equations (eg all the sum of squares formulae etc) and complete as many practice questions as you can possibly do.Receiving a reply to an email you sent to Almohalwas is a game of luck. You might receive a reply almost immediately or you might not receive one at all! Im I’ve received a reply to 2 out of the approx. 10 emails I’ve sent him during the duration of his class. I think someone should start a betting ring about his emails.He will release quizzes and homework's on CCLE without sending out emails so you best be on your toes!All in all, taking a class with Almohalwas is an experience. He is a really nice guy but a really bad professor. He cares deeply about his students learning but doesn’t know how to teach.
